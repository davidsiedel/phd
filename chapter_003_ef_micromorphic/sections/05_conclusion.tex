\section{Conclusions and perspectives}

This work has investigated the use of micromorphic behaviours for the
description of quasi-brittle materials and has shown that those
micromorphic behaviours can be considered as varitionaly consistent
approximations of standard phase-field models.
%
%
%
Three alternate minimization schemes, which are straightforward to
implement in standard FEM or FFT solvers, have been proposed, and their numerical performance has been investigated intensively using representative tests. 
%
%
%
Convergence of those schemes is guaranteed but requires a large number
of fixed-point iterations. Regarding this observation, the third
scheme appears to be more efficient.

The proposed approach can be extended to more complex damage behaviours
and ductile failure.
%
%
%
Finally, as a future work, acceleration schemes could also be
investigated to reduce the number of fixed-point iterations.
