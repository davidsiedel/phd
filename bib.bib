The discrete problem is written as the minimization of a broken nonlinear elastic energy where a local reconstruction of the displacement gradient is used. Two HHO methods are considered: a stabilized method where the gradient is reconstructed as a tensor-valued polynomial of order k and a stabilization is added to the discrete energy functional, and an unstabilized method which reconstructs a stable higher-order gradient and circumvents the need for stabilization. Both methods satisfy the principle of virtual work locally with equilibrated tractions. We present a numerical study of the two HHO methods on test cases with known solution and on more challenging three-dimensional test cases including ﬁnite deformations with strong shear layers and cavitating voids. We assess the computational efﬁciency of both methods, and we compare our results to those obtained with an industrial software using conforming ﬁnite elements and to results from the literature.

Its main interest is that it allows for the adoption of standard constitutive models established in a small-strain framework. This model is extended to take into account the plastic incompressibility constraint intrinsically. In that purpose, an extension of this model to a three-ﬁeld mixed ﬁnite element formulation is proposed, involving displacements, a strain variable and pressure as nodal variables with respect to standard ﬁnite element. Numerical examples of ﬁnite-strain problems are presented to assess the performance of the formulation.

	abstract = {This work addresses an efficient low order virtual element method (VEM) for the phase-field modeling of isotropic brittle fracture. Virtual elements were introduced in the last decade and applied to various problems in solid mechanics. The phase-field approach regularizes sharp crack surfaces within a pure continuum setting by a specific gradient damage modeling with constitutive terms rooted in fracture mechanics, see Miehe et al. [23] and Miehe et al. [29]. In the presented contribution, we propose a rigorous variational-based framework for the phase-field modeling of brittle fracture in elastic solids undergoing small strains. The key goal here, is the extension towards the recently developed virtual element formulation due to the flexible choice of nodes number in an element which can be changed easily during the simulation process, as outlined in Wriggers et al. [11] and Wriggers et al. [18]. To this end, the potential density is formulated in terms of suitable polynomial functions, instead of computing the unknown shape functions for complicated element geometries, e.g. arbitrary convex or concave polygonal elements. An important aspect of this work is the introduction of an incremental minimization principle, with a novel construction of the stabilization density for the coupled multi-field problem. On the computational side, a robust and efficient monolithic scheme is employed using the software tool ACEFEM program in the numerical implementation to compute the unknowns (displacement and crack phase-field), see Korelc and Wriggers [52]. The performance of the formulation is underlined by means of representative examples.},

	abstract = {A variational formulation is proposed for a family of elastic–plastic–damage models within the framework of rate-independent materials. That consists ﬁrst in deﬁning the total energy which contains, in particular, a gradient damage term and a term which represents the plastic dissipation but depends also on damage. Then, the evolution law is deduced from the principles of irreversibility, stability and energy balance. Accordingly, the plastic dissipation term which appears both in the damage criterion and the plastic yield criterion plays an essential role in the damage–plasticity coupling. Suitable constitutive choices on how the plastic yield stress decreases with damage, allows us to obtain a rich variety of coupled responses. A particular attention is paid on the equations which govern the formation of cohesive cracks where the displacement is discontinuous and the plasticity localizes. In the one-dimensional traction test where the solution is obtained in a closed form, we show that, because of damage localization, a cohesive crack really appears at the center of the damage zone before the rupture and the associated cohesive law is obtained in closed form in terms of the constitutive parameters. A Finite Element discrete version of the energy functional is used to simulate a two-dimensional traction test over a rectangular domain with mixed boundary conditions; again a localized band of plastic strain is generated seemingly independent of the mesh size.},

We start by providing an overview of the existing quasi-static and dynamic phase-ﬁeld fracture formulations from the physics and the mechanics communities. Within the formulations stemming from Grifﬁth’s theory, we focus on quasi-static models featuring a tension-compression split, which prevent cracking in compression and interpenetration of the crack faces upon closure, and on the staggered algorithmic implementation due to its proved robustness. In this paper, we establish an appropriate stopping criterion for the staggered scheme. Moreover, we propose and test the so-called hybrid formulation, which leads within a staggered implementation to an incrementally linear problem. This enables a signiﬁcant reduction of computational cost—about one order of magnitude—with respect to the available (non-linear) models. The conceptual and structural similarities of the hybrid formulation to gradient-enhanced continuum damage mechanics are outlined as well. Several benchmark problems are solved, including one with own experimental veriﬁcation.},

We focus on the linear elastic case where the contact condition appears as a local unilateral constraint on the displacement jump at the crack surfaces. The regularized model is obtained by splitting the strain energy in a spherical and a deviatoric parts and accounting for the sign of the local volume change. The numerical implementation is based on a standard ﬁnite element discretization and on the adaptation of an alternate minimization algorithm used in previous works. The new regularization avoids crack interpenetration and predicts asymmetric results in traction and in compression. Even though we do not exhibit any gamma-convergence proof toward the desired limit behavior, we illustrate through several numerical case studies the pertinence of the new model in comparison to other approaches.},

Although there are number of well-known mixed ﬁnite element pairs known for the analogous problem involving vector ﬁelds and scalar ﬁelds, the symmetry of the stress ﬁeld is a substantial additional difﬁculty, and the elements presented here are the ﬁrst ones using polynomial shape functions which are known to be stable. We present a family of such pairs of ﬁnite element spaces, one for each polynomial degree, beginning with degree two for the stress and degree one for the displacement, and show stability and optimal order approximation. We also analyze some obstructions to the construction of such ﬁnite element spaces, which account for the paucity of elements available.},

Thanks to the freedom in deﬁning the mesh topology, we propose a new h-adaptive technique based on agglomeration coarsening of a ﬁne mesh. The possibility to enhance the error distribution over the computational domain is investigated on a Poisson problem with the goal of obtaining a mesh independent discretization. The main building block of our dG method consists of deﬁning discrete polynomial spaces directly on physical frame elements. For this purpose we orthonormalize with respect to the L2-product a set of monomials relocated in a speciﬁc element frame and we introduce an easy way to reduce the cost related to numerical integration on agglomerated meshes. To complete the dG formulation for second order problems, two extensions of the BR2 scheme to arbitrary polyhedral grids, including an estimate of the stabilization parameter ensuring the coercivity property, are here proposed.},

	abstract = {The present paper aims at modeling complex fracture phenomena where different damaging mechanisms are involved. For this purpose, the standard one-variable phase-field/gradient damage model, able to regularize Griffith’s isotropic brittle fracture problem, is extended to describe different degradation mechanisms through several distinct damage variables. Associating with each damage variable a different dissipated fracture energy, the coupling between all mechanisms is achieved through the degradation of the elastic stiffness. The framework is very general and can be tailored to many situations where different fracture mechanisms are present as well as to model anisotropic fracture phenomena. In this first work, after a general presentation of the model, the attention is focused on a specific paradigmatic case, namely the brittle fracture problem of a 2D homogeneous orthotropic medium with two different damaging mechanisms with respect to the two orthogonal directions. Illustrative numerical applications consider propagation in mode I and II as well as kinking of cracks as a result of a transition between the two fracture mechanisms. It is shown that the proposed model and numerical implementation compares well with theoretical and experimental results, allowing to reproduce specific features of crack propagation in anisotropic materials whereas standard models using one damage variable seem unable to do so.},

When polynomials of degree k ě 1 are used as unknowns, we prove convergence in hk`1 (with h denoting, as usual, the meshsize) in an energy-like norm. A key ingredient in the proof are novel approximation results for the energy projector on local polynomial spaces. Under biharmonic regularity assumptions, a sharp estimate in hk`3 is also derived for the L2-norm of the error on the deﬂection. The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which additionally show the robustness of the method with respect to the choice of the stabilization.},

            We present two primal methods to weakly discretize (linear) Dirichlet and (nonlinear) Signorini boundary conditions in elliptic model problems. Both methods support polyhedral meshes with nonmatching interfaces and are based on a combination of the hybrid high-order (HHO) method and Nitsche’s method. Since HHO methods involve both cell unknowns and face unknowns, this leads to different formulations of Nitsche’s consistency and penalty terms, either using the trace of the cell unknowns (cell version) or using directly the face unknowns (face version). The face version uses equal-order polynomials for cell and face unknowns, whereas the cell version uses cell unknowns of one order higher than the face unknowns. For Dirichlet conditions, optimal error estimates are established for both versions. For Signorini conditions, optimal error estimates are proven only for the cell version. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and also reveal optimal convergence for the face version applied to Signorini conditions.},

For the later issue, we provide a new stabilization scheme that is based on the trace of the material tangent modulus tensor, which captures highly heterogeneous and localized deformations. Two VEM formulations are presented: a two-field mixed and an equivalent displacement-based, which is free of volumetric locking. Convergence and accuracy of the VEM formulations are verified by means of numerical examples, and engineering applications are demonstrated.},

Cell-based unknowns, which can be eliminated locally by a Schur complement technique (also known as static condensation), are also used in the formulation. Salient examples of high-order Discontinuous Skeletal methods are Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin methods and the recently-devised Hybrid High-Order methods. Some major benefits of Discontinuous Skeletal methods are that their construction is dimensionindependent and that they offer the possibility to use general meshes with polytopal cells and non-matching interfaces. In this work, we show how this mathematical flexibility can be efficiently replicated in a numerical software using generic programming. We describe a number of generic algorithms and data structures for high-order Discontinuous Skeletal methods within a ‘‘write once, run on any kind of mesh’’ framework. The computational efficiency of the implementation is assessed on the Poisson model problem discretized using various polytopal meshes and the Hybrid High-Order method.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review and reﬁne the main ideas for devising the so-called hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods; we do that in the framework of steady-state diffusion problems. We begin by revisiting the classic techniques of static condensation of continuous ﬁnite element methods and that of hybridization of mixed methods, and show that they can be reinterpreted as discrete versions of a characterization of the associated exact solution in terms of solutions of Dirichlet boundary-value problems on each element of the mesh which are then patched together by transmission conditions across interelement boundaries. We then deﬁne the HDG methods associated to this characterization as those using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to approximate the local Dirichlet boundary-value problems, and using weak impositions of the transmission conditions. We give simple conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of their approximate solutions, and show that, by their very construction, the HDG methods are amenable to static condensation. We do this assuming that the diffusivity tensor can be inverted; we also brieﬂy discuss the case in which it cannot. We then show how a different characterization of the exact solution, gives rise to a different way of statically condensing an already known HDG method. We devote the rest of the paper to establishing bridges between the HDG methods and other methods (the old DG methods, the mixed methods, the staggered DG method and the so-called Weak Galerkin method) and to describing recent efforts for the construction of HDG methods (one for systematically obtaining superconvergent methods and another, quite different, which gives rise to optimally convergent methods). We end by providing a few bibliographical notes and by brieﬂy describing ongoing work.},

This phenomenon disappears when the values of the stabilization function are increased. Mixed methods display the same problem, as their stabilization function is identically zero. Here, we ﬁnd explicit formulas for the lower bound of the values of the stabilization function which allow us to avoid this unpleasant phenomenon. Our numerical experiments show that, when we use polynomials of degree k {\textgreater} 0 for the approximate gradient, ﬁrst-order Piola-Kirchhoff and displacement, all the approximations converge with the optimal order, k þ 1. They also show that, if we increase the polynomial degree of the local spaces by one and update the values of the stabilization function only for the elements for which the elasticity tensor is indeﬁnite, we obtain that all approximate solutions converge with order k þ 1 and that a local post processing of the displacement converges with order k þ 2.},

	abstract = {We introduce a unifying framework for hybridization of ﬁnite element methods for second order elliptic problems. The methods ﬁtting in the framework are a general class of mixed-dual ﬁnite element methods including hybridized mixed, continuous Galerkin, non-conforming and a new, wide class of hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods. The distinctive feature of the methods in this framework is that the only globally coupled degrees of freedom are those of an approximation of the solution deﬁned only on the boundaries of the elements. Since the associated matrix is sparse, symmetric and positive deﬁnite, these methods can be eﬃciently implemented. Moreover, the framework allows, in a single implementation, the use of diﬀerent methods in diﬀerent elements or subdomains of the computational domain which are then automatically coupled. Finally, the framework brings about a new point of view thanks to which it is possible to see how to devise novel methods displaying very localized and simple mortaring techniques, as well as methods permitting an even further reduction of the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom.},

For every positive integer k, the row-wise divergence of the element space spans the set of polynomials of total degree k. The degrees of freedom are suited to achieve continuity of the normal stresses. What makes the element distinctive is that its dimension is the smallest required for enforcing a weak symmetry condition on the approximate stress. This is achieved using certain “bubble matrices”, which are special divergence-free matrix-valued polynomials. We prove that the approximation error is of order k + 1 in both the displacement and the stress, and that a postprocessed displacement approximation converging at order k + 2 can be computed element by element. We also show that the globally coupled degrees of freedom can be reduced by hybridization to those of a displacement approximation on the element boundaries.},

The degrees of freedom are vector-valued polynomials of arbitrary order k 1 on the mesh faces, so that in three space dimensions, the lowest-order scheme only requires 9 degrees of freedom per mesh face. The method can be deployed on general polyhedral meshes. The key idea is to reconstruct the symmetric gradient and divergence inside each mesh cell in terms of the degrees of freedom by solving inexpensive local problems. The discrete problem is assembled cell-wise using these operators and a high-order stabilization bilinear form. Locking-free error estimates are derived for the energy norm and for the L2-norm of the displacement, with optimal convergence rates of order (k + 1) and (k + 2), respectively, for smooth solutions on general meshes. The theoretical results are confirmed numerically, and the CPU cost is evaluated on both standard and polygonal meshes.},

These are new generation numerical methods for PDEs with several advantageous features: the support of arbitrary approximation orders on general polyhedral meshes, the reproduction at the discrete level of relevant continuous properties, and a reduced computational cost thanks to static condensation and compact stencil. After establishing the discrete setting, we introduce the basics of HHO methods using as a model problem the Poisson equation. We describe in detail the construction, and prove a priori convergence results for various norms of the error as well as a posteriori estimates for the energy norm. We then consider two applications: the discretization of the nonlinear p-Laplace equation and of scalar diffusion-advection-reaction problems. The former application is used to introduce compactness analysis techniques to study the convergence to minimal regularity solution. The latter is used to introduce the discretization of ﬁrst-order operators and the weak enforcement of boundary conditions. Numerical examples accompany the exposition.},

After reviewing some fundamentals of isogeometric analysis, we investigate the use of higher-order Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) within the B¯ projection method. The higher-continuity property of such functions is explored in nearly incompressible applications and shown to produce accurate and robust results. A new nonlinear F¯ projection method, based on a modiﬁed minimum potential energy principle and inspired by the B¯ method is proposed for the large-deformation case. It leads to a symmetric formulation for which the consistent linearized operator for fully nonlinear elasticity is derived and used in a Newton-Raphson iterative procedure. The performance of the methods is assessed on several numerical examples, and results obtained are shown to compare favorably with other published techniques.},

The foremost goal behind it is to enhance the robustness of the method without deteriorating the accuracy of the resulting solutions. Its distinctive property is that for nonlinear elastic problems the stabilization term is solution dependent, and hence it is termed an adaptive stabilization mechanism. The key contribution of this paper is the construction of a stabilization strategy for which the method is perfectly stable, since the stabilization parameters can be explicitly computed as part of the numerical solution. This is accomplished through the main result of this paper, which consists of a theorem that provides lower bounds for the size of the stabilization parameters. Numerical examples conﬁrm the guaranteed stability of the resulting method. However, they also show that the computed lower bounds overestimate the minimum amount of stabilization needed, negatively affecting the approximation properties of the method. These results underscore the fact that a better understanding of the stabilization mechanisms is needed in order to construct a method that is both robust and efﬁcient.},

The model is a strongly nonlinear non-convex variational inequality that demands the resolution of small length scales. The current standard algorithm for its solution, alternate minimization, is robust but converges slowly and demands the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear subproblems. In this paper, we propose several advances in the numerical solution of this model that improve its computational efﬁciency. We reformulate alternate minimization as a nonlinear Gauss–Seidel iteration and employ over-relaxation to accelerate its convergence; we compose this accelerated alternate minimization with Newton’s method, to further reduce the time to solution, and we formulate efﬁcient preconditioners for the solution of the linear subproblems arising in both alternate minimization and in Newton’s method. We investigate the improvements in efﬁciency on several examples from the literature; the new solver is ﬁve to six times faster on a majority of the test cases considered. © 2016 The Authors International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {A unifying thermomechanical framework is presented that reconciles several classes of gradient elastoviscoplasticity and damage models proposed in the literature during the last 40 years. It is based on the introduction of the micromorphic counterpart ␹␾ of a selected state or internal variable ␾ in a standard constitutive model. In addition to the classical balance of momentum equation, a balance of micromorphic momentum is derived that involves generalized stress tensors. The corresponding additional boundary conditions are also deduced from the procedure. The power of generalized forces is assumed to contribute to the energy balance equation. The free energy density function is then chosen to depend on a relative generalized strain, typically ␾-␹␾, and the microstrain gradient ١␹␾. When applied to the deformation gradient itself, ␾ ϵ F{\textgreater} , the method yields the micromorphic theory of Eringen and Mindlin together with its extension to ﬁnite deformation elastoviscoplasticity by Forest and Sievert. If the selected variable is the cumulative plastic strain, the theory reduces to the so-called “nonlocal implicit gradient-enhanced elastoplasticity model” by Engelen, Geers, and Peerlings, provided that simpliﬁed linear relationships are adopted between generalized stresses and strains. The same holds if the micromorphic variable coincides with a microdamage variable. If the internal constraint is introduced that the micromorphic variable ␹␾ remains as close as possible to the macroscopic variable ␾, the micromorphic model reduces to the second gradient or gradient of internal variable approach as deﬁned by Maugin. If the selected variable is the cumulative plastic strain or the full plastic strain tensor, the constrained micromorphic theory delivers Aifantis-like strain gradient plasticity models. The advantage of the micromorphic approach is that it provides the generalized balance equation under nonisothermal conditions and offers the setting for anisotropic nonlinear constitutive relations between generalized stress and strains in contrast to most existing models. In rate-independent plasticity, it is shown that there is generally no need for a variational formulation of the yield condition.},

In order to compare the methods, two 2-dimensional test problems are approximated, one having a smooth solution and the second one presenting a square root singularity in a boundary node. The different formulations are compared in terms of the L2 norm of the approximation errors in the solution and in its gradient (the ﬂux). The tests are performed with h reﬁnement with constant order of approximation p, as well as for a given hp reﬁnement procedure. For the problem with a smooth solution, the results conﬁrm convergence orders predicted by theoretical a priori error estimates. As expected, the application of hp reﬁnement to the singular problem improves considerably the performance of all methods. Furthermore, due to the type of the singularity (square root), the efﬁciency of continuous and discontinuous Galerkin formulations is further improved by using enriched spaces with quarter-point elements. Regarding continuous, hybrid and mixed formulations, the effect of using static condensation of element equations is also analysed, in order to illustrate the reduction in the global system of equations in each case. A third comparison is given in terms of the conservation of the ﬂux over a curve around a singularity.},

While volume-locking is a well-known problem that can be dealt with in many diﬀerent discretization approaches, the concept of gradient-robustness for linear elasticity is new. We discuss both aspects and propose novel Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for linear elasticity. The starting point for these methods is a divergence-conforming discretization. As a consequence of its well-behaved Stokes limit the method is gradient-robust and free of volume-locking. To improve computational eﬃciency, we additionally consider discretizations with relaxed divergence-conformity and a modiﬁcation which re-enables gradientrobustness, yielding a robust and quasi-optimal discretization also in the sense of HDG superconvergence.},

	abstract = {Irreversible evolution is one of the central concepts as well as implementation challenges of both the variational approach to fracture by Francfort and Marigo (1998) and its regularized counterpart by Bourdin, Francfort and Marigo (2000, 2007 and 2008), which is commonly referred to as a phase-field model of brittle fracture. Irreversibility of the crack phase-field imposed to prevent fracture healing leads to a constrained minimization problem, whose optimality condition is given by a variational inequality. In our study, the irreversibility is handled via penalization. Provided the penalty constant is well-tuned, the penalized formulation is a good approximation to the original one, with the advantage that the induced equality-based weak problem enables a much simpler algorithmic treatment. We propose an analytical procedure for deriving the optimal penalty constant, more precisely, its lower bound, which guarantees a sufficiently accurate enforcement of the crack phase-field irreversibility. Our main tool is the notion of the optimal phase-field profile, as well as the Γ -convergence result. It is shown that the explicit lower bound is a function of two formulation parameters (the fracture toughness and the regularization length scale) but is independent of the problem setup (geometry, boundary conditions etc.), the formulation ingredients (degradation function, tension–compression split etc.), as well as the discretization (mesh size). The optimally-penalized formulation is tested for three benchmark problems, including one with available analytical solution. We also compare our results with those obtained by using the alternative irreversibility technique based on the notion of the history field by Miehe et al. (2010).},

The degrees of freedom of the Lagrange multipliers, which approximate the displacements at the faces, solve a symmetric positive-deﬁnite system. The design and analysis of this method is motivated by a new set of unisolvent degrees of freedom for symmetric polynomial matrices. These new degrees of freedom are also used to give a new simple calculation of the dimension of the space of polynomial symmetric matrix ﬁelds with vanishing normal traces and zero divergence on a tetrahedron. Such a dimension count was important in the development of the symmetric H(div) conforming methods found in [D. N. Arnold, G. Awanou, and R. Winther, Math. Comp., 77 (2008), pp. 1229–1251].},

Low-order approximations on triangles are adopted, with the use of three interior penalty DG methods, viz. nonsymmetric, symmetric and incomplete. It is known that these methods are uniformly convergent in the incompressible limit for the isotropic case. This work focuses on behaviour in the inextensible limit for transverse isotropy. An error estimate suggests the possibility of extensional locking, a feature that is confirmed by numerical experiments. Under-integration of the extensional edge terms is proposed as a remedy. This modification is shown to lead to an error estimate that is consistent with lockingfree behaviour. Numerical tests confirm the uniformly convergent behaviour, at an optimal rate, of the under-integrated scheme.},

Until recently, cheap and seemingly limitless fossil energy has allowed most of society to ignore the importance of contributions to the economic process from the biophysical world as well as the potential limits to growth. This paper centers on assessing the energy costs of modern day society and its relation to GDP. Our most important focus is the characteristics of our major energy sources including each fuel's energy return on investment (EROI). The EROI of our most important fuels is declining and most renewable and nonconventional energy alternatives have substantially lower EROI values than traditional conventional fossil fuels. At the societal level, declining EROI means that an increasing proportion of energy output and economic activity must be diverted to attaining the energy needed to run an economy, leaving less discretionary funds available for “non-essential” purchases which often drive growth. The declining EROI of traditional fossil fuel energy sources and the effect of that on the world economy are likely to result in a myriad of consequences, most of which will not be perceived as good.},

Numerically, such problems can be treated with Galerkin ﬁnite elements and primal-dual active set methods. Speciﬁcally, low-order and high-order ﬁnite elements may be employed, where, for the latter, only few studies exist to date. The most time-consuming part in the discrete version of the primal-dual active set (semi-smooth Newton) algorithm consists in the solutions of changing linear systems arising at each semi-smooth Newton step. We propose a new parallel matrix-free monolithic multigrid preconditioner for these systems. We provide two numerical tests, and discuss the performance of the parallel solver proposed in the paper.

We show that it can be recast as a minimization problem of a non-linear functional over a space of discontinuous approximations to the displacement. The functional can be written as the sum over the elements of the classic potential energy plus a new energy associated to the inter-element jumps of the displacement. We then show that if this new energy is not properly weighted, the minimizers might not converge to the exact solution. We construct an example illustrating this phenomenon and show how to overcome it by suitably increasing the weight of the energy of the inter-element jumps. Finally, we explore the performance of the method for the case of piecewise-linear approximations in rather demanding situations in both two-dimensional and, for the first time, three-dimensional situations. They include almost incompressible materials, large deformations with large-shear layers, and cavitation. We also compare the method with the continuous Galerkin method and a previously explored discontinuous Galerkin method, and show that, when using piecewise-linear approximations and a moderate number of degrees of freedom, the current method turns out to be more efficient for the computation of the gradient.},

Its numerical treatment is reduced to the design of a mixed ﬁnite element so that algorithms such as Newton’s method and path-following techniques are still available. Possible convergence difﬁculties related to the reduction of the damage band width and the appearance of micro instabilities are removed thanks to the design of a new class of brittle laws. Finally, numerical applications show the convergence with mesh reﬁnement, the compatibility with coarser approaches such as Grifﬁth’s theory and cohesive crack models, the robustness in case of unstable multi-cracking, the applicability to full-scale 3D situations and the physical relevance compared to experimental data.},

To fulﬁll the fracture irreversibility constraint, we consider a formulation as a variational inequality in the phase-ﬁeld variable. For adaptive mesh reﬁnement, we use a recently developed residual-type a posteriori error estimator for the phase-ﬁeld variational inequality which is eﬃcient and reliable, and robust with respect to the phase-ﬁeld regularization parameter. The proposed model and the adaptive error-based reﬁnement strategy are demonstrated by means of numerical tests derived from the L-shaped panel test, originally developed for concrete.

Strongly marked by a “continental” (French-Italian) inﬂuence, it has successfully incorporated the basic invariances of modern continuum mechanics while capturing the spirit of twentieth-century analysis (generalized functions or distributions) in which it became synonymous of weak formulation. It proved to provide the surest and safest way to formulate complex theories of continua (so-called “generalized continuum mechanics”, theory of coupled ﬁelds, etc) and approximate or generalized theories of structural members and the associated natural boundary conditions while preparing the way for the full thermomechanical formulation, providing the best setting for the proof of various mathematical theorems, and paving the way for modern numerical methods. The present contribution, illustrated by many examples of varying complexity, emphasizes the role of Paul Germain (1920–2009) in this formulation. The author, himself an active contributor and a never tired propagandist of the method, has participated in these developments during four decades and presents here his witness but critical viewpoint, highlighting the difﬁcult points and also the esthetically pleasing ones where necessary.},

The focus here is on algorithmic and computational aspects of the formulation at ﬁnite strains. The adoption of a logarithmic hyperelastic–plastic formulation preserves the essential features of the inﬁnitesimal formulation. This key ingredient allows the predictor–corrector solution algorithms developed for the inﬁnitesimal gradient formulation to be extended readily to the ﬁnite-strain regime. The use of low-order elements is essential to contain the computational expense of the formulation but these elements are prone to locking. The method of enhanced assumed strains for geometrically nonlinear problems is utilised to circumvent this limitation. The form of the consistent tangent modulus is derived for the case of gradient plasticity. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate aspects of the approximation scheme and the algorithm, as well as features of the model of gradient plasticity.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a modular formulation and computational implementation of a class of anisotropic plasticity models at ﬁnite strains based on incremental minimization principles. The modular kinematic setting consists of a constitutive model in the logarithmic strain space that is framed by a purely geometric pre- and postprocessing. On the theoretical side, the point of departure is an a priori six-dimensional approach to ﬁnite plasticity based on the notion of a plastic metric. In a ﬁrst step, a geometric preprocessor deﬁnes a total and a plastic logarithmic strain measure obtained from the current and the plastic metrics, respectively. In a second step, these strains enter in an additive format a constitutive model of anisotropic plasticity that may have a structure identical to the geometrically linear theory. The model deﬁnes the stresses and consistent tangents work-conjugate to the logarithmic strain measure. In a third step these objects of the logarithmic space are then mapped back to nominal, Lagrangian or Eulerian objects by a geometric postprocessor. This geometric three-step-approach deﬁnes a broad class of anisotropic models of ﬁnite plasticity directly related to counterparts of the geometrically linear theory. It is speciﬁed to a model problem of anisotropic metal plasticity. On the computational side we develop an incremental variational formulation of the above outlined constitutive structure where a quasi-hyperelastic stress potential is obtained from a local constitutive minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this minimization problem is exclusively restricted to the logarithmic strain space in a structure identical to the small-strain theory. The minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for ﬁnite increments of time. We develop a discrete formulation in terms of just one scalar parameter for the amount of incremental ﬂow. The existence of the incremental stress potential provides a natural basis for the deﬁnition of the geometric postprocessor based on function evaluations. Furthermore, the global initialboundary-value-problem of the elastic–plastic solid appears in the incremental setting as an energy minimization problem. Numerical examples show that the results obtained are surprisingly close to those obtained by a reference framework of multiplicative plasticity.},

	abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase ﬁeld. Following our recent work [C. Miehe, F. Welschinger, M. Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent phase ﬁeld models of fracture: Variational principles and multi-ﬁeld fe implementations, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering DOI:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-ﬁeld-type fracture, we propose in this paper a new variational framework for rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the introduction of a local history ﬁeld. It contains a maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation history, which may be considered as a measure for the maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown that this local variable drives the evolution of the crack phase ﬁeld. The introduction of the history ﬁeld provides a very transparent representation of the balance equation that governs the diffusive crack topology. In particular, it allows for the construction of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture. Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split scheme that successively updates in a typical time step the history ﬁeld, the crack phase ﬁeld and ﬁnally the displacement ﬁeld. A regularization based on a viscous crack resistance that even enhances the robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of the phase ﬁeld formulation of fracture by means of representative numerical examples.},

	abstract = {We present hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving steady and timedependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in continuum mechanics. The essential ingredients are a local Galerkin projection of the underlying PDEs at the element level onto spaces of polynomials of degree k to parametrize the numerical solution in terms of the numerical trace; a judicious choice of the numerical ﬂux to provide stability and consistency; and a global jump condition that enforces the continuity of the numerical ﬂux to arrive at a global weak formulation in terms of the numerical trace. The HDG methods are fully implicit, high-order accurate and endowed with several unique features which distinguish themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, they reduce the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the solution on element boundaries, thereby leading to a signiﬁcant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Second, they provide, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of all the variables which converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm. Third, they possess some superconvergence properties that allow us to deﬁne inexpensive element-by-element postprocessing procedures to compute a new approximate solution which may converge with higher order than the original solution. And fourth, they allow for a novel and systematic way for imposing boundary conditions for the total stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the methods. In addition, they possess other interesting properties for speciﬁc problems. Their approximate solution can be postprocessed to yield an exactly divergence-free and H(div)-conforming velocity ﬁeld for incompressible ﬂows. They do not exhibit volumetric locking for nearly incompressible solids. We provide extensive numerical results to illustrate their distinct characteristics and compare their performance with that of continuous Galerkin methods. Ó 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

By exploiting the advantage of mesh flexibility in the VEM, we establish an adaptive mesh refinement strategy based on the superconvergent patch recovery for triangular, quadrilateral as well as for arbitrary polygonal meshes. For the local stiffness matrix in VEM, we adopt a stabilization term which is stable for both isotropic scaling and ratio. Stress intensity factors (SIFs) of a polygonal mesh are discussed and solved by using the interaction domain integral. The present VEM formulations are finally tested and validated by studying its convergence rate for both continuous and discontinuous problems, and are compared with the optimal convergence rate in the conventional Finite Element Method (FEM). Furthermore, the adaptive mesh refinement strategies used to effectively predict the crack growth with the existence of hanging nodes in nonconforming elements are examined.},

	abstract = {A discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the boundary value problem of ﬁnite-deformation elasticity is presented. The primary purpose is to establish a discontinuous Galerkin framework for large deformations of solids in the context of statics and simple material behaviour with a view toward further developments involving behaviour or models where the DG concept can show its superiority compared to the continuous formulation. The method is based on a general Hu–Washizu–de Veubeke functional allowing for displacement and stress discontinuities in the domain interior. It is shown that this approach naturally leads to the formulation of average stress ﬂuxes at interelement boundaries in a ﬁnite element implementation. The consistency and linearized stability of the method in the non-linear range as well as its convergence rate are proven. An implementation in three dimensions is developed, showing that the proposed method can be integrated into conventional ﬁnite element codes in a straightforward manner. In order to demonstrate the versatility, accuracy and robustness of the method examples of application and convergence studies in three dimensions are provided.

	title = {Hybrid {High}-{Order} methods for nonlinear solid mechanics},
	abstract = {In this thesis, we are interested in the devising of Hybrid High-Order (HHO) methods for nonlinear solid mechanics. HHO methods are formulated in terms of face unknowns on the mesh skeleton. Cell unknowns are also introduced for the stability and approximation properties of the method. HHO methods oﬀer several advantages in solid mechanics: (i) primal formulation; (ii) free of volumetric locking due to incompressibility constraints; (iii) arbitrary approximation order k ≥ 1 ; (iv) support of polyhedral meshes with possibly nonmatching interfaces; and (v) attractive computational costs due to the static condensation to eliminate locally cell unknowns while keeping a compact stencil. In this thesis, primal HHO methods are devised to solve the problem of ﬁnite hyperelastic deformations and small plastic deformations. An extension to ﬁnite elastoplastic deformations is also presented within a logarithmic strain framework. Finally, a combination with Nitsche’s approach allows us to impose weakly the unilateral contact and Tresca friction conditions. Optimal convergence rates of order hk+1 are proved in the energy-norm. All these methods have been implemented in both the open-source library disk++ and the open-source industrial software code\_aster. Various two- and three-dimensional benchmarks are considered to validate these methods and compare them with H1-conforming and mixed ﬁnite element methods.},

The method relies cruciallyon a local multiplicativedecomposition of the deformation gradient into a conforming and an enhanced part, formulated in the context of a three-field variational formulation. The resulting class of mixed methods provides a possible extension to the nonlinear regime of well-known incompatible mode formulations. In addition, this class of methods includes non-linear generalizations of recently proposed enhanced strain interpolations for axisymmetric problems which cannot be interpreted as incompatible modes elements. The good performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated in a number of simulations including 2-D, 3-D and axisymmetric finite deformation problems in elasticity and elastoplasticity. Remarkably, these methods appear to be specially well suited for problems involving localization of the deformation, as illustrated in several numerical examples.},

It then discusses the principles of constitutive theory and examples of constitutive models, presents a foundational treatment of energy principles and stability theory, and concludes with example closed-form solutions and the essentials of finite elements. Together with its companion book, Modeling Materials, (Cambridge University Press, 2011), this work presents the fundamentals of multiscale materials modeling for graduate students and researchers in physics, materials science, chemistry and engineering"--},

These methods are endowed with several salient features. The equations that deﬁne the numerical scheme are the Euler–Lagrange equations of a oneﬁeld variational principle, a trait that provides an elegant and simple derivation of the method. In consonance with general discontinuous Galerkin formulations, it is possible within this framework to choose different numerical ﬂuxes. Numerical evidence suggests the absence of locking at nearincompressible conditions in the ﬁnite deformations regime when piecewise linear elements are adopted. Finally, a conceivable surprising characteristic is that, as demonstrated with numerical examples, these methods provide a given accuracy level for a comparable, and often lower, computational cost than conforming formulations.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes and analyzes an adaptive stabilization strategy for enhanced strain (ES) methods applied to quasistatic non-linear elasticity problems. The approach is formulated for any type of enhancements or material models, and it is distinguished by the fact that the stabilization term is solution dependent. The stabilization strategy is ﬁrst constructed for general linearized elasticity problems, and then extended to the non-linear elastic regime via an incremental variational principle. A heuristic choice of the stabilization parameters is proposed, which in the numerical examples proved to provide stable approximations for a large range of deformations, different problems and material models. We also provide explicit lower bounds for the stabilization parameters that guarantee that the method will be stable. These are not advocated, since they are generally larger than the ones based on heuristics, and hence prone to deteriorate the locking-free behavior of ES methods. Numerical examples with two different non-linear elastic models in thin geometries and incompressible situations show that the method remains stable and locking free over a large range of deformations. Finally, the method is strongly based on earlier developments for discontinuous Galerkin methods, and hence throughout the paper we offer a perspective about the similarities between the two.

One of the limitations of the continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method (CGFEM) when applied to incompressible elasticity is that the accuracy of the numerical solution may be adversely affected by the phenomenon known as locking—this may prevent the use of a low order polynomial approximation to the displacement on each element. We demonstrate using simulations that the DGFEM presented here does not suffer from this drawback. Two further advantages in this setting of this DGFEM over CGFEMs are that: (i) highly anisotropic meshes—meshes containing elements with a very high aspect ratio—may be used without signiﬁcantly degrading the accuracy of the solution; and (ii) discontinuities in the elasticity parameters are handled more effectively.},

	abstract = {Our goal in this work is to develop and compare modified Newton methods for fully monolithic quasi-static brittle phasefield fracture propagation. In variational phase-field fracture, a smoothed phase-field indicator variable denoting the crack path is coupled to elasticity. Moreover, a crack irreversibility condition is incorporated. To develop a fully monolithic scheme is an extremely challenging task since the underlying problem is non-convex and the Jacobian of Newton’s method is indefinite. To split the problem using alternating minimization, thus a partitioned approach, is a possible resort. However, there are good reasons to consider monolithic approaches such as for example robustness and efficiency. Although an error-oriented Newton method can cope with a larger variety of configurations, it appears that this method is not always robust and also not always efficient. Inspired by nonlinear flow problems, as alternative, we develop a modified Newton scheme in which globalization is based on a dynamic modification of the Jacobian matrix rather than utilizing line-search or trust-region strategies. This variation switches smoothly between full Newton and Newton-like steps. In several 2D and 3D numerical examples, all of them with different characteristic features, our modified Newton solver is compared to a backtracking line-search Newton method, another line-search method monitoring the global energy and allowing for negative curvatures, and to already published results of an error-oriented version. These computations also include further modifications of Newton’s method and detailed discussions why certain schemes either work or fail. Revisiting all findings, the main outcome of this paper is that the modified Newton scheme with Jacobian modification is currently the only method that works in a robust and efficient way for all provided examples, whereas line-search schemes or the error-oriented scheme show deficiencies for certain configurations.},

	abstract = {High-order numerical methods for unstructured grids combine the superior accuracy of high-order spectral or finite difference methods with the geometric flexibility of low-order finite volume or finite element schemes. The Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach unifies various high-order schemes for unstructured grids within a single framework. Additionally, the FR approach exhibits a significant degree of element locality, and is thus able to run efficiently on modern streaming architectures, such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The aforementioned properties of FR mean it offers a promising route to performing affordable, and hence industrially relevant, scale-resolving simulations of hitherto intractable unsteady flows within the vicinity of real-world engineering geometries. In this paper we present PyFR, an open-source Python based framework for solving advection–diffusion type problems on streaming architectures using the FR approach. The framework is designed to solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids containing various element types. It is also designed to target a range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific language based on the Mako templating engine. The current release of PyFR is able to solve the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on grids of quadrilateral and triangular elements in two dimensions, and hexahedral elements in three dimensions, targeting clusters of CPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs. Results are presented for various benchmark flow problems, single-node performance is discussed, and scalability of the code is demonstrated on up to 104 NVIDIA M2090 GPUs.

	abstract = {Despite the versatility in modeling complex crack conﬁgurations, phase-ﬁeld damage models for fracture usually count only one in-house codes, greatly restricting their potential applications. It is thus of vital importance to implement them in those commonly used commercial software packages like Abaqus. However, so far only the less robust Newton’s monolithic algorithm or the inefﬁcient staggered solver has been considered. In this work, taking the uniﬁed phase-ﬁeld damage theory (Wu, 2017) as the particular example, we present three distinct strategies of implementing phase-ﬁeld damage models into Abaqus: (i) UMAT-Newton-M: a thermo-mechanically coupled user-deﬁned material (UMAT) implementation of the modiﬁed Newton monolithic solver; (ii) UEL-Staggered: a novel user-deﬁned element (UEL) implementation of the iterative staggered (alternate minimization) algorithm with dummy dofs; (iii) UEL-BFGS: a UEL implementation of the recently advocated BFGS quasi-Newton monolithic algorithm. The aforesaid implementation strategies are then validated against several representative benchmark problems of brittle fracture and quasi-brittle failure. It is found that, the UMAT-Newton-M implementation is the simplest but not robust enough, while the UEL-Staggered implementation is robust but extremely inefﬁcient. Comparatively, in all cases the UELBFGS scheme is of the best numerical performance with lest iterations and sufﬁcient robustness. For the sake of reproducibility of the presented numerical results and the promotion of phase-ﬁeld damage models, the source codes (programmed in the free format syntax of FORTRAN90) are also provided and interested users can download them at https://github.com/jianyingwu/pfczm-abaqus.},

	abstract = {The major goal of this work is to develop a robust modelling strategy for the simulation of ductile damage development including crack initiation and subsequent propagation. For that purpose, a Gurson‐type model is used. This model class, as many other damage models, leads to significant material softening and must be used within a large deformation framework due to the ductile character of the materials. This leads to 2 main difficulties that should be dealt with carefully: mesh dependency and volumetric locking. In this work, a logarithmic finite strain framework is adopted in which the Gurson‐TvergaardNeedleman constitutive law is reformulated. Then a nonlocal formulation with regularisation of hardening variable is applied so as to solve mesh dependency and strain localization problem. In addition, the nonlocal model is combined with mixed “displacement‐pressure‐volume variation” elements to avoid volumetric locking. Thereby, a mesh‐independent and locking‐free finite strain framework suitable for the modelling of ductile rupture is established. Attention is paid to mathematical properties and numerical performance of the model. Finally, the model parameters are identified on an experimental database for a nuclear piping steel. Simulations of standard test specimens (notched tensile bars and compact tension and single edge notched tensile cracked specimens) are performed and compared to experimental results.},

In this article, we first formulate the quasi-static evolution problem for a general class of such damage models. Then, we introduce a stability criterion in terms of the positivity of the second derivative of the total energy under the unilateral constraint induced by the irreversibility of damage. These concepts are applied in the particular setting of a one-dimensional traction test. We construct homogeneous as well as localized damage solutions in a closed form and illustrate the concepts of loss of stability, of scale effects, of damage localization, and of structural failure. Considering several specific constitutive models, stress—displacement curves, stability diagrams, and energy dissipation provide identification criteria for the relevant material parameters, such as limit stress and internal length. Finally, the 1D analytical results are compared with the numerical solution of the evolution problem in a 2D setting.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the application of the so-called hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to linear elasticity problems. The method has three signiﬁcant features. The ﬁrst is that the only globally coupled degrees of freedom are those of an approximation of the displacement deﬁned solely on the faces of the elements. The corresponding stiffness matrix is symmetric, positive deﬁnite, and possesses a block-wise sparse structure that allows for a very efﬁcient implementation of the method. The second feature is that, when polynomials of degree k are used to approximate the displacement and the stress, both variables converge with the optimal order of k+1 for any k 0. The third feature is that, by using an element-by-element post-processing, a new approximate displacement can be obtained that converges at the order of k +2, whenever k 2. Numerical experiments are provided to compare the performance of the HDG method with that of the continuous Galerkin (CG) method for problems with smooth solutions, and to assess its performance in situations where the CG method is not adequate, that is, when the material is nearly incompressible and when there is a crack.

A simple postprocessing is introduced which takes advantage of the special structure of the method. It allows us to construct an approximation to the displacement which is H(div)-conforming and to enforce the equation that links the pressure to the divergence of the displacement strongly inside each element. As a consequence, when the material is exactly incompressible, the displacement is also exactly incompressible. This is achieved without having to deal with the almost impossible task of constructing ﬁnite dimensional subspaces of incompressible displacements. We provide an error analysis of the method that holds uniformly with respect to the Poisson ratio. In particular, we show that the displacement converges in L2 with order k + 1 when polynomials of degree k {\textgreater} 0 are used. We also display numerical experiments conﬁrming that the theoretical orders of convergence are actually achieved and that they do not deteriorate when the material becomes incompressible.},

	abstract = {In the extended finite element method (XFEM), errors are caused by parasitic terms in the approximation space of the blending elements at the edge of the enriched subdomain. A discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation is developed, which circumvents this source of error. A patch-based version of the DG formulation is developed, which decomposes the domain into enriched and unenriched subdomains. Continuity between patches is enforced with an internal penalty method. An element-based form is also developed, where each element is considered a patch. The patch-based DG is shown to have similar accuracy to the element-based DG for a given discretization but requires significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The method is applied to material interfaces, cracks and dislocation problems. For the dislocations, a contour integral form of the internal forces that only requires integration over the patch boundaries is developed. A previously developed assumed strain (AS) method is also developed further and compared with the DG method for weak discontinuities and linear elastic cracks. The DG method is shown to be significantly more accurate than the standard XFEM for a given element size and to converge optimally, even where the standard XFEM does not. The accuracy of the DG method is similar to that of the AS method but requires less application-specific coding. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We introduce here a variant of the XFEM rendering an optimally convergent scheme. Its distinguishing features are as follows: (a) the introduction of singular asymptotic crack tip fields with support on only a small region around the crack tip (the enrichment region), (b) only one and two enrichment functions are added for anti-plane shear and planar problems, respectively and (c) the relaxation of the continuity between the enrichment region and the rest of the domain, and the adoption of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method therein. The method is provably stable for any positive value of a stabilization parameter, and by weakly enforcing the continuity between the two regions it eliminates ‘blending elements’ partly responsible for the suboptimal convergence of some early XFEMs. Moreover, the particular choice of enrichment functions results in a surprisingly sparse stiffness matrix that remains reasonably conditioned as the mesh is refined. More importantly, the stress intensity factors can be extracted with a satisfactory accuracy as primary unknowns. Quadrature strategies required for the optimal convergence are also discussed. Finally, the DG method was modified to retain stability based on an inf-sup condition. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The treatment for this discontinuity, generally a non-polynomial function, is facilitated by a specially designed discontinuous Galerkin method based on the Bassi–Rebay numerical flux. The stability of the method is contingent upon an inf–sup condition, which we have proved to hold for any quasiuniform mesh family with sufficiently fine meshes.

The scheme is based on a semi-explicit temporal discretization with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the Stokes operator. The nonlinear term is discretized in divergence form by using the local Lax–Friedrichs ﬂuxes; thus, local conservativity is inherent. Spatial discretization of the Stokes operator has employed both equal-order (Pk À Pk) and mixed-order (Pk À PkÀ1) velocity and pressure approximations. A second-order approximate algebraic splitting is used to decouple the velocity and pressure calculations leading to an algebraic Helmholtz equation for each component of the velocity and a consistent Poisson equation for the pressure. The consistent Poisson operator is replaced by an equivalent (in stability and convergence) operator, namely that arising from the interior penalty discretization of the standard Poisson operator with appropriate boundary conditions. This yields a simpler and more eﬃcient method, characterized by a compact stencil size.},

	abstract = {We present a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the numerical solution of steady and time-dependent linear convection–diffusion equations. We devise the method as follows. First, we express the approximate scalar variable and corresponding ﬂux within each element in terms of an approximate trace of the scalar variable along the element boundary. We then deﬁne a unique value for the approximate trace by enforcing the continuity of the normal component of the ﬂux across the element boundary; a global equation system solely in terms of the approximate trace is thus obtained. The high number of globally coupled degrees of freedom in the discontinuous Galerkin approximation is therefore signiﬁcantly reduced.

	abstract = {We present an implicit high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the steady-state and time-dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The method is devised by using the discontinuous Galerkin discretization for a velocity gradient-pressure–velocity formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with a special choice of the numerical traces. The method possesses several unique features which distinguish itself from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, it reduces the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the velocity and the mean of the pressure on element boundaries, thereby leading to a signiﬁcant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Moreover, if the augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the linearized system, the globally coupled unknowns become the approximate trace of the velocity only. Second, it provides, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of the velocity, pressure, and velocity gradient which converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm, when polynomials of degree kP0 are used for all components of the approximate solution. And third, it displays superconvergence properties that allow us to use the above-mentioned optimal convergence properties to deﬁne an element-by-element postprocessing scheme to compute a new and better approximate velocity. Indeed, this new approximation is exactly divergence-free, H (div)-conforming, and converges with order k + 2 for k P 1 and with order 1 for k = 0 in the L2-norm. Moreover, a novel and systematic way is proposed for imposing boundary conditions for the stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the method. This can be done on different parts of the boundary and does not result in the degradation of the optimal order of convergence properties of the method. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy properties of the method for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and for various polynomial degrees.},

We introduce a continuous mapping between a ﬁxed reference conﬁguration and the time-varying domain. By writing the Navier–Stokes equations as a conservation law for the independent variables in the reference conﬁguration, the complexity introduced by variable geometry is reduced to solving a transformed conservation law in a ﬁxed reference conﬁguration. The spatial discretization is carried out using the Discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured meshes of triangles, while the time integration is performed using an explicit Runge–Kutta method. For general domain changes, the standard scheme fails to preserve exactly the free-stream solution which leads to some accuracy degradation, especially for low order approximations. This situation is remedied by adding an additional equation for the time evolution of the transformation Jacobian to the original conservation law and correcting for the accumulated metric integration errors. A number of results are shown to illustrate the ﬂexibility of the approach to handle high-order approximations on complex geometries.},

We show under general assumptions the existence of a discrete solution, which is also unique provided a data smallness condition is veriﬁed. Using a compactness argument, we prove convergence of the sequence of discrete solutions to minimal regularity exact solutions for general data. For more regular solutions, we prove optimal convergence rates for the energy-norm of the velocity and the L2-norm of the pressure under a standard data smallness assumption.

	abstract = {The phase-field approach regularizes the variational theory of fracture by approximating cracks with a smeared damage field. In this work, the attention is focused on those formulations approximating mode II fractures (shear fractures). In these models, only the deviatoric part of the strain elastic energy, penalized by the phase-field, drives the crack onset and evolution, whereas the elastic hydrostatic energetic contribution has no influence on the failure process. Consequently, cracks evolves according to the von Mises–Hencky–Hüber, also known as J2, failure criterion. Unfortunately, volumetric locking problem arises in the damaged zones if classical numerical solution strategies are adopted. As a consequence, damage localization bands appear with an excessive thickness, thus overestimating the fracture energy. In addition, the crack path geometry may be erroneously described because of the loss of precision of the displacement field in damaged zones. To circumvent these drawbacks, two numerical techniques are proposed, namely selective reduced integration and mixed displacement/pressure formulation, and their effectiveness evidenced by a numerical investigation.},

Within this framework, incompatible elements arise as particular 'compatible' mixed approximations of the enhanced strain field. The conditions that the stress interpolation contain piece-wise constant functions and be L,-orthsgonal to the enhanced strain interpolation,ensure satisfaction of the patch test and allow the elimination of the stress field from the formulation. The preceding conditions are formulated in a form particularly convenient for element design. As an illustration of the methodology three new elements are developed and shown to exhibit good performance: a plane 3D elastic/plasticQUAD, an axisymmetric element and a thick plate bending QUAD. The formulation described herein is suitable for non-linear analysis.},
