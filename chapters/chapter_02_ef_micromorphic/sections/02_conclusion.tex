\subsection{Conclusions and perspectives}

This work has investigated the use of micromorphic behaviours for the
description of quasi-brittle materials and has shown that those
micromorphic behaviours can be considered as varitionaly consistent
approximations of standard phase-field models.

Three alternate minimisation schemes, which is straightforward to
implement in standard FEM or FFT solvers, have been proposed.

Convergence of those schemes is guaranteed but requires a large number
of fixed-point iterations. With respect to this observation, the third
scheme appears to be more efficient.

The proposed approach can be extended to more complex damage behaviours
and ductile failure.

However, as a future work, acceleration schemes could also be
investigated to reduce the number of fixed-point iterations.
