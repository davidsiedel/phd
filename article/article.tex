  \begin{abstract}
    This paper describes discusses a class of micromorphic damage behaviours for quasi-brittle
    materials in the varionnal framework of simple generalized standard materials.
    Their links with the classical AT1 and AT2 phase-field models is discussed. It is shown that
    those micromorphic damage behaviours can be seen as approximations of the latter. A numerical
    parameter allows to control the degree of approximation.
    Micromorphic damage behaviours exhibits the following advantages:
    (i) The irreversibility constraint is treated locally, at the integration points.
    (ii) The balance equations are standard partial derivative equations which can readily be solved
    by most FEM or FFT solvers.
    (iii) The variational framework allows the derivation of (at least) three alternate minimisation
    schemes.
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item The irreversibility constraint is treated locally, at the integration points.
    %     \item The balance equations are standard partial derivative equations which can readily be solved
    %     by most FEM or FFT solvers.
    %     \item The variational framework allows the derivation of (at least) three alternate minimisation
    %     schemes.
    % \end{itemize}
    Numerical experiments performed using mgis.fenics python module allow to compare numeri-
    cally the presented micromorphic damage behaviours and the phase field AT1 and AT2 models on a
    set of tests classically used in the litterature.
    Finally, those micromorphic damage behaviours have been implemented in the MFEM/MGIS library.
    This implementation is shown to perform well with higher order finite elements on a test proposed by
    Alessi et al. A description of the fragmentation of a nuclear fuel pellet demonstrates the applicability
    of those behavious on large scale industrial problems.
    % This paper aims at highlighting the link between the
    % Hu–Washizu variational formulation and the family of Hybrid
    % Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, with a focus on one of
    % their latest refinement, the Hybrid High Order (HHO) method.
    % % To the best of our knowledge, this link has never been described in the
    % % litterature.
    % It is shown that the main ingredients of HDG methods can be derived from the minimization of a Hu–Washizu Lagrangian
    % where elements are connected by an elastic interface.
    % % The advanced stabilisation operator introduced by HHO method can't
    % % however be derived from this approach.
    % %
    % %
    % %
    % The aim of this perspective is two-fold:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %   \item Most introductory materials to HDG/HHO methods
    %   are focused on mathematical aspects. An approach
    %   based on physical considerations might help spreading these methods
    %   to the computational mechanics and engineering communities.
    %   \item A new resolution algorithm, called cell equilibriume is derived from this approach, and is described
    %   in depth in this paper as an alternative to the static
    %   condensation scheme for the elimination of cell unknowns. Advantages
    %   and disadvantages of both strategies are discussed. Other
    %   promising lines of research are described, though their detailed
    %   study is left for future works.
    % \end{itemize}
    % %
    % %
    % %
    % Practical implementation of these methods is also discussed
    % in depth using notations closed to the ones used in standard finite
    % elements textbooks, highlighting the use of polyhedral cells and the
    % use of approximation spaces based on polynomials of arbitrary
    % orders.
    % %
    % %
    % %
    % The resolution of axi-symmetrical problems, which has seldom,
    % if ever, been discussed in the literature, is then presented.
    % %
    % %
    % %
    % Numerical examples prove the robustness of the method
    % with regards to volumetric locking and the applicability
    % of the new resolution scheme.
