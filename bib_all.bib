	abstract = {Fixed point iterations are still the most common approach to dealing with a variety of numerical problems such as coupled problems (multi-physics, domain decomposition, …) or nonlinear problems (electronic structure, heat transfer, nonlinear mechanics, …). Methods to accelerate fixed point iteration convergence or more generally sequence convergence have been extensively studied since the 1960’s. For scalar sequences, the most popular and efficient acceleration method remains the Δ 2 of Aitken. Various vector acceleration algorithms are available in the literature, which often aim at being multi-dimensional generalizations of the Δ 2 method.

In this paper, we propose and analyse a generic residual-based formulation for accelerating vector sequences. The question of the dynamic use of this residual-based transformation during the fixed point iterations for obtaining a new accelerated fixed point method is then raised. We show that two main classes of such iterative algorithms can be derived and that this approach is generic in that various existing acceleration algorithms for vector sequences are thereby recovered.

In order to illustrate the interest of such algorithms, we apply them in the field of nonlinear mechanics on a simplified “point-wise” solver used to perform mechanical behaviour unit testings. The proposed test cases clearly demonstrate that accelerated fixed point iterations based on the elastic operator (quasi-Newton method) are very useful when the mechanical behaviour does not provide the so-called consistent tangent operator. Moreover, such accelerated algorithms also prove to be competitive with respect to the standard Newton–Raphson algorithm when available.},

The HHO methods use as discrete unknowns piecewise polynomials of order k ≥ 1 on the mesh skeleton, together with cell-based polynomials that can be eliminated locally by static condensation. The discrete problem is written as the minimization of a broken nonlinear elastic energy where a local reconstruction of the displacement gradient is used. Two HHO methods are considered: a stabilized method where the gradient is reconstructed as a tensor-valued polynomial of order k and a stabilization is added to the discrete energy functional, and an unstabilized method which reconstructs a stable higher-order gradient and circumvents the need for stabilization. Both methods satisfy the principle of virtual work locally with equilibrated tractions. We present a numerical study of the two HHO methods on test cases with known solution and on more challenging three-dimensional test cases including ﬁnite deformations with strong shear layers and cavitating voids. We assess the computational efﬁciency of both methods, and we compare our results to those obtained with an industrial software using conforming ﬁnite elements and to results from the literature.

Its main interest is that it allows for the adoption of standard constitutive models established in a small-strain framework. This model is extended to take into account the plastic incompressibility constraint intrinsically. In that purpose, an extension of this model to a three-ﬁeld mixed ﬁnite element formulation is proposed, involving displacements, a strain variable and pressure as nodal variables with respect to standard ﬁnite element.

	abstract = {This work addresses an efficient low order virtual element method (VEM) for the phase-field modeling of isotropic brittle fracture. Virtual elements were introduced in the last decade and applied to various problems in solid mechanics. The phase-field approach regularizes sharp crack surfaces within a pure continuum setting by a specific gradient damage modeling with constitutive terms rooted in fracture mechanics, see Miehe et al. [23] and Miehe et al. [29]. In the presented contribution, we propose a rigorous variational-based framework for the phase-field modeling of brittle fracture in elastic solids undergoing small strains. The key goal here, is the extension towards the recently developed virtual element formulation due to the flexible choice of nodes number in an element which can be changed easily during the simulation process, as outlined in Wriggers et al. [11] and Wriggers et al. [18]. To this end, the potential density is formulated in terms of suitable polynomial functions, instead of computing the unknown shape functions for complicated element geometries, e.g. arbitrary convex or concave polygonal elements. An important aspect of this work is the introduction of an incremental minimization principle, with a novel construction of the stabilization density for the coupled multi-field problem. On the computational side, a robust and efficient monolithic scheme is employed using the software tool ACEFEM program in the numerical implementation to compute the unknowns (displacement and crack phase-field), see Korelc and Wriggers [52]. The performance of the formulation is underlined by means of representative examples.},

	abstract = {A variational formulation is proposed for a family of elastic–plastic–damage models within the framework of rate-independent materials. That consists ﬁrst in deﬁning the total energy which contains, in particular, a gradient damage term and a term which represents the plastic dissipation but depends also on damage. Then, the evolution law is deduced from the principles of irreversibility, stability and energy balance. Accordingly, the plastic dissipation term which appears both in the damage criterion and the plastic yield criterion plays an essential role in the damage–plasticity coupling. Suitable constitutive choices on how the plastic yield stress decreases with damage, allows us to obtain a rich variety of coupled responses. A particular attention is paid on the equations which govern the formation of cohesive cracks where the displacement is discontinuous and the plasticity localizes. In the one-dimensional traction test where the solution is obtained in a closed form, we show that, because of damage localization, a cohesive crack really appears at the center of the damage zone before the rupture and the associated cohesive law is obtained in closed form in terms of the constitutive parameters. A Finite Element discrete version of the energy functional is used to simulate a two-dimensional traction test over a rectangular domain with mixed boundary conditions; again a localized band of plastic strain is generated seemingly independent of the mesh size.},

We start by providing an overview of the existing quasi-static and dynamic phase-ﬁeld fracture formulations from the physics and the mechanics communities. Within the formulations stemming from Grifﬁth’s theory, we focus on quasi-static models featuring a tension-compression split, which prevent cracking in compression and interpenetration of the crack faces upon closure, and on the staggered algorithmic implementation due to its proved robustness. In this paper, we establish an appropriate stopping criterion for the staggered scheme. Moreover, we propose and test the so-called hybrid formulation, which leads within a staggered implementation to an incrementally linear problem. This enables a signiﬁcant reduction of computational cost—about one order of magnitude—with respect to the available (non-linear) models. The conceptual and structural similarities of the hybrid formulation to gradient-enhanced continuum damage mechanics are outlined as well. Several benchmark problems are solved, including one with own experimental veriﬁcation.},

Revisiting brittle fracture as an energy minimization problem. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 46 (8), 1319–1342]. We focus on the linear elastic case where the contact condition appears as a local unilateral constraint on the displacement jump at the crack surfaces. The regularized model is obtained by splitting the strain energy in a spherical and a deviatoric parts and accounting for the sign of the local volume change. The numerical implementation is based on a standard ﬁnite element discretization and on the adaptation of an alternate minimization algorithm used in previous works. The new regularization avoids crack interpenetration and predicts asymmetric results in traction and in compression. Even though we do not exhibit any gamma-convergence proof toward the desired limit behavior, we illustrate through several numerical case studies the pertinence of the new model in comparison to other approaches.},

The screened-Poisson equation is employed to relate the kinematic Green-Lagrange strain with the mixed strain. The strain vector obtained from the face normals is now a (vector) degree-of-freedom at each face. In contrast with variational multiscale methods, there are no parameters to ﬁt and stability in compression is veriﬁed. When compared with smoothed ﬁnite-elements, the formulation is straightforward and sparsity pattern of the classical system retained, albeit with high computational cost. In contrast with traditional gradient-enhanced formulations, a theoretically sound mixed formulation underlies the algorithm. High accuracy is obtained for four-node tetrahedra with incompressibility and bending benchmarks being solved. Traditional ﬁnite-strain benchmarks and a quasi-brittle damage numerical test are performed, with very competitive results.},

This requires the development of a compatible pair of ﬁnite element spaces, one to discretize the space of symmetric tensors in which the stress ﬁeld is sought, and one to discretize the space of vector ﬁelds in which the displacement is sought. Although there are number of well-known mixed ﬁnite element pairs known for the analogous problem involving vector ﬁelds and scalar ﬁelds, the symmetry of the stress ﬁeld is a substantial additional difﬁculty, and the elements presented here are the ﬁrst ones using polynomial shape functions which are known to be stable. We present a family of such pairs of ﬁnite element spaces, one for each polynomial degree, beginning with degree two for the stress and degree one for the displacement, and show stability and optimal order approximation. We also analyze some obstructions to the construction of such ﬁnite element spaces, which account for the paucity of elements available.},

The possibility to enhance the error distribution over the computational domain is investigated on a Poisson problem with the goal of obtaining a mesh independent discretization. The main building block of our dG method consists of deﬁning discrete polynomial spaces directly on physical frame elements. For this purpose we orthonormalize with respect to the L2-product a set of monomials relocated in a speciﬁc element frame and we introduce an easy way to reduce the cost related to numerical integration on agglomerated meshes. To complete the dG formulation for second order problems, two extensions of the BR2 scheme to arbitrary polyhedral grids, including an estimate of the stabilization parameter ensuring the coercivity property, are here proposed.},

	abstract = {The present paper aims at modeling complex fracture phenomena where different damaging mechanisms are involved. For this purpose, the standard one-variable phase-field/gradient damage model, able to regularize Griffith’s isotropic brittle fracture problem, is extended to describe different degradation mechanisms through several distinct damage variables. Associating with each damage variable a different dissipated fracture energy, the coupling between all mechanisms is achieved through the degradation of the elastic stiffness. The framework is very general and can be tailored to many situations where different fracture mechanisms are present as well as to model anisotropic fracture phenomena. In this first work, after a general presentation of the model, the attention is focused on a specific paradigmatic case, namely the brittle fracture problem of a 2D homogeneous orthotropic medium with two different damaging mechanisms with respect to the two orthogonal directions. Illustrative numerical applications consider propagation in mode I and II as well as kinking of cracks as a result of a transition between the two fracture mechanisms. It is shown that the proposed model and numerical implementation compares well with theoretical and experimental results, allowing to reproduce specific features of crack propagation in anisotropic materials whereas standard models using one damage variable seem unable to do so.},

Additionally, the method satisﬁes a local principle of virtual work inside each mesh element, with interface tractions that obey the law of action and reaction.

            We present two primal methods to weakly discretize (linear) Dirichlet and (nonlinear) Signorini boundary conditions in elliptic model problems. Both methods support polyhedral meshes with nonmatching interfaces and are based on a combination of the hybrid high-order (HHO) method and Nitsche’s method. Since HHO methods involve both cell unknowns and face unknowns, this leads to different formulations of Nitsche’s consistency and penalty terms, either using the trace of the cell unknowns (cell version) or using directly the face unknowns (face version). The face version uses equal-order polynomials for cell and face unknowns, whereas the cell version uses cell unknowns of one order higher than the face unknowns. For Dirichlet conditions, optimal error estimates are established for both versions. For Signorini conditions, optimal error estimates are proven only for the cell version. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and also reveal optimal convergence for the face version applied to Signorini conditions.},

For the later issue, we provide a new stabilization scheme that is based on the trace of the material tangent modulus tensor, which captures highly heterogeneous and localized deformations. Two VEM formulations are presented: a two-field mixed and an equivalent displacement-based, which is free of volumetric locking. Convergence and accuracy of the VEM formulations are verified by means of numerical examples, and engineering applications are demonstrated.},

Some major benefits of Discontinuous Skeletal methods are that their construction is dimensionindependent and that they offer the possibility to use general meshes with polytopal cells and non-matching interfaces. In this work, we show how this mathematical flexibility can be efficiently replicated in a numerical software using generic programming. We describe a number of generic algorithms and data structures for high-order Discontinuous Skeletal methods within a ‘‘write once, run on any kind of mesh’’ framework. The computational efficiency of the implementation is assessed on the Poisson model problem discretized using various polytopal meshes and the Hybrid High-Order method.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review and reﬁne the main ideas for devising the so-called hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods; we do that in the framework of steady-state diffusion problems. We begin by revisiting the classic techniques of static condensation of continuous ﬁnite element methods and that of hybridization of mixed methods, and show that they can be reinterpreted as discrete versions of a characterization of the associated exact solution in terms of solutions of Dirichlet boundary-value problems on each element of the mesh which are then patched together by transmission conditions across interelement boundaries. We then deﬁne the HDG methods associated to this characterization as those using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to approximate the local Dirichlet boundary-value problems, and using weak impositions of the transmission conditions. We give simple conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of their approximate solutions, and show that, by their very construction, the HDG methods are amenable to static condensation. We do this assuming that the diffusivity tensor can be inverted; we also brieﬂy discuss the case in which it cannot. We then show how a different characterization of the exact solution, gives rise to a different way of statically condensing an already known HDG method. We devote the rest of the paper to establishing bridges between the HDG methods and other methods (the old DG methods, the mixed methods, the staggered DG method and the so-called Weak Galerkin method) and to describing recent efforts for the construction of HDG methods (one for systematically obtaining superconvergent methods and another, quite different, which gives rise to optimally convergent methods). We end by providing a few bibliographical notes and by brieﬂy describing ongoing work.},

	abstract = {It is now a well known fact that hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin for nonlinear elasticity may not converge to the exact solution if their inter-element jumps are not properly penalized or, equivalently, if the values of their stabilization function are not suitably chosen. For example, if their stabilization function is of order one, the method generates spurious oscillations in the region in which the elastic moduli tensor is indeﬁnite. This phenomenon disappears when the values of the stabilization function are increased. Mixed methods display the same problem, as their stabilization function is identically zero. Here, we ﬁnd explicit formulas for the lower bound of the values of the stabilization function which allow us to avoid this unpleasant phenomenon. Our numerical experiments show that, when we use polynomials of degree k {\textgreater} 0 for the approximate gradient, ﬁrst-order Piola-Kirchhoff and displacement, all the approximations converge with the optimal order, k þ 1. They also show that, if we increase the polynomial degree of the local spaces by one and update the values of the stabilization function only for the elements for which the elasticity tensor is indeﬁnite, we obtain that all approximate solutions converge with order k þ 1 and that a local post processing of the displacement converges with order k þ 2.},

This can be done, so far, for simplexes, parallelepipeds and prisms. Finally, we show how, by means of an elementwise computation, we can obtain divergence-free velocity approximations converging faster than the original velocity approximation when working with simplicial elements.

The methods ﬁtting in the framework are a general class of mixed-dual ﬁnite element methods including hybridized mixed, continuous Galerkin, non-conforming and a new, wide class of hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods. The distinctive feature of the methods in this framework is that the only globally coupled degrees of freedom are those of an approximation of the solution deﬁned only on the boundaries of the elements. Since the associated matrix is sparse, symmetric and positive deﬁnite, these methods can be eﬃciently implemented. Moreover, the framework allows, in a single implementation, the use of diﬀerent methods in diﬀerent elements or subdomains of the computational domain which are then automatically coupled. Finally, the framework brings about a new point of view thanks to which it is possible to see how to devise novel methods displaying very localized and simple mortaring techniques, as well as methods permitting an even further reduction of the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom.},

For every positive integer k, the row-wise divergence of the element space spans the set of polynomials of total degree k. The degrees of freedom are suited to achieve continuity of the normal stresses. What makes the element distinctive is that its dimension is the smallest required for enforcing a weak symmetry condition on the approximate stress. This is achieved using certain “bubble matrices”, which are special divergence-free matrix-valued polynomials. We prove that the approximation error is of order k + 1 in both the displacement and the stress, and that a postprocessed displacement approximation converging at order k + 2 can be computed element by element. We also show that the globally coupled degrees of freedom can be reduced by hybridization to those of a displacement approximation on the element boundaries.},

The proof hinges on the classical Dupont–Scott approximation theory together with two novel abstract lemmas: An approximation result for bounded projectors, and an [Formula: see text]-boundedness result for [Formula: see text]-orthogonal projectors on polynomial subspaces. The [Formula: see text]-approximation results have general applicability to (standard or polytopal) numerical methods based on local polynomial spaces. As an illustration, we use these [Formula: see text]-estimates to derive novel error estimates for a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) discretisation of Leray–Lions elliptic problems whose weak formulation is classically set in [Formula: see text] for some [Formula: see text]. This kind of problems appears, e.g. in the modelling of glacier motion, of incompressible turbulent flows, and in airfoil design. Denoting by [Formula: see text] the meshsize, we prove that the approximation error measured in a [Formula: see text]-like discrete norm scales as [Formula: see text] when [Formula: see text] and as [Formula: see text] when [Formula: see text].},

The method relies on a pure-displacement (primal) formulation and leads to a symmetric, positive definite system matrix with compact stencil. The degrees of freedom are vector-valued polynomials of arbitrary order k 1 on the mesh faces, so that in three space dimensions, the lowest-order scheme only requires 9 degrees of freedom per mesh face. The method can be deployed on general polyhedral meshes. The key idea is to reconstruct the symmetric gradient and divergence inside each mesh cell in terms of the degrees of freedom by solving inexpensive local problems. The discrete problem is assembled cell-wise using these operators and a high-order stabilization bilinear form. Locking-free error estimates are derived for the energy norm and for the L2-norm of the displacement, with optimal convergence rates of order (k + 1) and (k + 2), respectively, for smooth solutions on general meshes. The theoretical results are confirmed numerically, and the CPU cost is evaluated on both standard and polygonal meshes.},

The proof is based on a reformulation of the elasticity problem as a Stokes system with nonzero divergence constraint. This result is then used to design a locking-free discontinuous Galerkin method. The key point is to make sure that the multiplicative constant in the estimate of the convergence rate uniquely depends on this bounded quantity. Thanks to a ﬁne tuning of the penalty term, the lower bound for the penalty parameter appearing in the method is simply expressed in terms of the space dimension. To conclude, numerical validation of the theoretical results is provided.},

These are new generation numerical methods for PDEs with several advantageous features: the support of arbitrary approximation orders on general polyhedral meshes, the reproduction at the discrete level of relevant continuous properties, and a reduced computational cost thanks to static condensation and compact stencil. After establishing the discrete setting, we introduce the basics of HHO methods using as a model problem the Poisson equation. We describe in detail the construction, and prove a priori convergence results for various norms of the error as well as a posteriori estimates for the energy norm. We then consider two applications: the discretization of the nonlinear p-Laplace equation and of scalar diffusion-advection-reaction problems. The former application is used to introduce compactness analysis techniques to study the convergence to minimal regularity solution. The latter is used to introduce the discretization of ﬁrst-order operators and the weak enforcement of boundary conditions. Numerical examples accompany the exposition.},

The discrete problem is assembled cellwise, and cell-based unknowns can be eliminated locally by static condensation. HHO methods support general meshes, are locally conservative, and allow for a robust treatment of physical parameters in various situations, e.g., heterogeneous/anisotropic diﬀusion, quasi-incompressible linear elasticity, and advectiondominated transport. This paper reviews HHO methods for a variable-diﬀusion model problem with nonhomogeneous, mixed Dirichlet–Neumann boundary conditions, including both primal and mixed formulations.

The higher-continuity property of such functions is explored in nearly incompressible applications and shown to produce accurate and robust results. A new nonlinear F¯ projection method, based on a modiﬁed minimum potential energy principle and inspired by the B¯ method is proposed for the large-deformation case. It leads to a symmetric formulation for which the consistent linearized operator for fully nonlinear elasticity is derived and used in a Newton-Raphson iterative procedure. The performance of the methods is assessed on several numerical examples, and results obtained are shown to compare favorably with other published techniques.},

The foremost goal behind it is to enhance the robustness of the method without deteriorating the accuracy of the resulting solutions. Its distinctive property is that for nonlinear elastic problems the stabilization term is solution dependent, and hence it is termed an adaptive stabilization mechanism. The key contribution of this paper is the construction of a stabilization strategy for which the method is perfectly stable, since the stabilization parameters can be explicitly computed as part of the numerical solution. This is accomplished through the main result of this paper, which consists of a theorem that provides lower bounds for the size of the stabilization parameters. Numerical examples conﬁrm the guaranteed stability of the resulting method. However, they also show that the computed lower bounds overestimate the minimum amount of stabilization needed, negatively affecting the approximation properties of the method. These results underscore the fact that a better understanding of the stabilization mechanisms is needed in order to construct a method that is both robust and efﬁcient.},

	abstract = {The variational approach to fracture is effective for simulating the nucleation and propagation of complex crack patterns but is computationally demanding. The model is a strongly nonlinear non-convex variational inequality that demands the resolution of small length scales. The current standard algorithm for its solution, alternate minimization, is robust but converges slowly and demands the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear subproblems. In this paper, we propose several advances in the numerical solution of this model that improve its computational efﬁciency. We reformulate alternate minimization as a nonlinear Gauss–Seidel iteration and employ over-relaxation to accelerate its convergence; we compose this accelerated alternate minimization with Newton’s method, to further reduce the time to solution, and we formulate efﬁcient preconditioners for the solution of the linear subproblems arising in both alternate minimization and in Newton’s method. We investigate the improvements in efﬁciency on several examples from the literature; the new solver is ﬁve to six times faster on a majority of the test cases considered. © 2016 The Authors International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {A unifying thermomechanical framework is presented that reconciles several classes of gradient elastoviscoplasticity and damage models proposed in the literature during the last 40 years. It is based on the introduction of the micromorphic counterpart ␹␾ of a selected state or internal variable ␾ in a standard constitutive model. In addition to the classical balance of momentum equation, a balance of micromorphic momentum is derived that involves generalized stress tensors. The corresponding additional boundary conditions are also deduced from the procedure. The power of generalized forces is assumed to contribute to the energy balance equation. The free energy density function is then chosen to depend on a relative generalized strain, typically ␾-␹␾, and the microstrain gradient ١␹␾. When applied to the deformation gradient itself, ␾ ϵ F{\textgreater} , the method yields the micromorphic theory of Eringen and Mindlin together with its extension to ﬁnite deformation elastoviscoplasticity by Forest and Sievert. If the selected variable is the cumulative plastic strain, the theory reduces to the so-called “nonlocal implicit gradient-enhanced elastoplasticity model” by Engelen, Geers, and Peerlings, provided that simpliﬁed linear relationships are adopted between generalized stresses and strains. The same holds if the micromorphic variable coincides with a microdamage variable. If the internal constraint is introduced that the micromorphic variable ␹␾ remains as close as possible to the macroscopic variable ␾, the micromorphic model reduces to the second gradient or gradient of internal variable approach as deﬁned by Maugin. If the selected variable is the cumulative plastic strain or the full plastic strain tensor, the constrained micromorphic theory delivers Aifantis-like strain gradient plasticity models. The advantage of the micromorphic approach is that it provides the generalized balance equation under nonisothermal conditions and offers the setting for anisotropic nonlinear constitutive relations between generalized stress and strains in contrast to most existing models. In rate-independent plasticity, it is shown that there is generally no need for a variational formulation of the yield condition.},

The implemented formulations are: (a) the classical H1 weak formulation (continuous); (b) the non-symmetric discontinuous Galerkin formulation by Baumann, Oden and Babuska; (c) a mixed discontinuous Galerkin formulation, known as Local Discontinuous Galerkin (LDG); (d) a mixed HðdivÞ-conforming formulation; (e) a primal hybrid formulation. In order to compare the methods, two 2-dimensional test problems are approximated, one having a smooth solution and the second one presenting a square root singularity in a boundary node. The different formulations are compared in terms of the L2 norm of the approximation errors in the solution and in its gradient (the ﬂux). The tests are performed with h reﬁnement with constant order of approximation p, as well as for a given hp reﬁnement procedure. For the problem with a smooth solution, the results conﬁrm convergence orders predicted by theoretical a priori error estimates. As expected, the application of hp reﬁnement to the singular problem improves considerably the performance of all methods. Furthermore, due to the type of the singularity (square root), the efﬁciency of continuous and discontinuous Galerkin formulations is further improved by using enriched spaces with quarter-point elements. Regarding continuous, hybrid and mixed formulations, the effect of using static condensation of element equations is also analysed, in order to illustrate the reduction in the global system of equations in each case. A third comparison is given in terms of the conservation of the ﬂux over a curve around a singularity.},

While volume-locking is a well-known problem that can be dealt with in many diﬀerent discretization approaches, the concept of gradient-robustness for linear elasticity is new. We discuss both aspects and propose novel Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for linear elasticity. The starting point for these methods is a divergence-conforming discretization. As a consequence of its well-behaved Stokes limit the method is gradient-robust and free of volume-locking. To improve computational eﬃciency, we additionally consider discretizations with relaxed divergence-conformity and a modiﬁcation which re-enables gradientrobustness, yielding a robust and quasi-optimal discretization also in the sense of HDG superconvergence.},

	abstract = {Irreversible evolution is one of the central concepts as well as implementation challenges of both the variational approach to fracture by Francfort and Marigo (1998) and its regularized counterpart by Bourdin, Francfort and Marigo (2000, 2007 and 2008), which is commonly referred to as a phase-field model of brittle fracture. Irreversibility of the crack phase-field imposed to prevent fracture healing leads to a constrained minimization problem, whose optimality condition is given by a variational inequality. In our study, the irreversibility is handled via penalization. Provided the penalty constant is well-tuned, the penalized formulation is a good approximation to the original one, with the advantage that the induced equality-based weak problem enables a much simpler algorithmic treatment. We propose an analytical procedure for deriving the optimal penalty constant, more precisely, its lower bound, which guarantees a sufficiently accurate enforcement of the crack phase-field irreversibility. Our main tool is the notion of the optimal phase-field profile, as well as the Γ -convergence result. It is shown that the explicit lower bound is a function of two formulation parameters (the fracture toughness and the regularization length scale) but is independent of the problem setup (geometry, boundary conditions etc.), the formulation ingredients (degradation function, tension–compression split etc.), as well as the discretization (mesh size). The optimally-penalized formulation is tested for three benchmark problems, including one with available analytical solution. We also compare our results with those obtained by using the alternative irreversibility technique based on the notion of the history field by Miehe et al. (2010).},

The design and analysis of this method is motivated by a new set of unisolvent degrees of freedom for symmetric polynomial matrices. These new degrees of freedom are also used to give a new simple calculation of the dimension of the space of polynomial symmetric matrix ﬁelds with vanishing normal traces and zero divergence on a tetrahedron. Such a dimension count was important in the development of the symmetric H(div) conforming methods found in [D. N. Arnold, G. Awanou, and R. Winther, Math. Comp., 77 (2008), pp. 1229–1251].},

	abstract = {This work studies discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approximations of the boundary value problem for homogeneous transversely isotropic linear elastic bodies. Low-order approximations on triangles are adopted, with the use of three interior penalty DG methods, viz. nonsymmetric, symmetric and incomplete. It is known that these methods are uniformly convergent in the incompressible limit for the isotropic case. This work focuses on behaviour in the inextensible limit for transverse isotropy. An error estimate suggests the possibility of extensional locking, a feature that is confirmed by numerical experiments. Under-integration of the extensional edge terms is proposed as a remedy. This modification is shown to lead to an error estimate that is consistent with lockingfree behaviour. Numerical tests confirm the uniformly convergent behaviour, at an optimal rate, of the under-integrated scheme.},

Until recently, cheap and seemingly limitless fossil energy has allowed most of society to ignore the importance of contributions to the economic process from the biophysical world as well as the potential limits to growth. This paper centers on assessing the energy costs of modern day society and its relation to GDP. Our most important focus is the characteristics of our major energy sources including each fuel's energy return on investment (EROI). The EROI of our most important fuels is declining and most renewable and nonconventional energy alternatives have substantially lower EROI values than traditional conventional fossil fuels. At the societal level, declining EROI means that an increasing proportion of energy output and economic activity must be diverted to attaining the energy needed to run an economy, leaving less discretionary funds available for “non-essential” purchases which often drive growth. The declining EROI of traditional fossil fuel energy sources and the effect of that on the world economy are likely to result in a myriad of consequences, most of which will not be perceived as good.},

Numerically, such problems can be treated with Galerkin ﬁnite elements and primal-dual active set methods. Speciﬁcally, low-order and high-order ﬁnite elements may be employed, where, for the latter, only few studies exist to date. The most time-consuming part in the discrete version of the primal-dual active set (semi-smooth Newton) algorithm consists in the solutions of changing linear systems arising at each semi-smooth Newton step. We propose a new parallel matrix-free monolithic multigrid preconditioner for these systems. We provide two numerical tests, and discuss the performance of the parallel solver proposed in the paper. Furthermore, we compare our new preconditioner with a block-AMG preconditioner available in the literature.},

We show that it can be recast as a minimization problem of a non-linear functional over a space of discontinuous approximations to the displacement. The functional can be written as the sum over the elements of the classic potential energy plus a new energy associated to the inter-element jumps of the displacement. We then show that if this new energy is not properly weighted, the minimizers might not converge to the exact solution. We construct an example illustrating this phenomenon and show how to overcome it by suitably increasing the weight of the energy of the inter-element jumps. Finally, we explore the performance of the method for the case of piecewise-linear approximations in rather demanding situations in both two-dimensional and, for the first time, three-dimensional situations. They include almost incompressible materials, large deformations with large-shear layers, and cavitation. We also compare the method with the continuous Galerkin method and a previously explored discontinuous Galerkin method, and show that, when using piecewise-linear approximations and a moderate number of degrees of freedom, the current method turns out to be more efficient for the computation of the gradient.},

To retrieve a well-posed problem, the material state is described through the gradients of damage in addition to the strain and the damage. Under some assumptions, it is shown that these gradient laws can be cast into a variational formulation. Its numerical treatment is reduced to the design of a mixed ﬁnite element so that algorithms such as Newton’s method and path-following techniques are still available. Possible convergence difﬁculties related to the reduction of the damage band width and the appearance of micro instabilities are removed thanks to the design of a new class of brittle laws. Finally, numerical applications show the convergence with mesh reﬁnement, the compatibility with coarser approaches such as Grifﬁth’s theory and cohesive crack models, the robustness in case of unstable multi-cracking, the applicability to full-scale 3D situations and the physical relevance compared to experimental data.},

In order to cope with locking eﬀects, we use a recently proposed mixed form where we have a hydro-static pressure as additional unknown besides the displacement ﬁeld and the phase-ﬁeld variable. To fulﬁll the fracture irreversibility constraint, we consider a formulation as a variational inequality in the phase-ﬁeld variable. For adaptive mesh reﬁnement, we use a recently developed residual-type a posteriori error estimator for the phase-ﬁeld variational inequality which is eﬃcient and reliable, and robust with respect to the phase-ﬁeld regularization parameter. The proposed model and the adaptive error-based reﬁnement strategy are demonstrated by means of numerical tests derived from the L-shaped panel test, originally developed for concrete. Here, the Poisson’s ratio is changed from the standard setting towards the incompressible limit ν → 0.5.},

	abstract = {In a period of a few decades, the formulation known as the principle of virtual power (PVP) has gained a prominent place among the most efﬁcient tools in the thermomechanics of continua. Strongly marked by a “continental” (French-Italian) inﬂuence, it has successfully incorporated the basic invariances of modern continuum mechanics while capturing the spirit of twentieth-century analysis (generalized functions or distributions) in which it became synonymous of weak formulation. It proved to provide the surest and safest way to formulate complex theories of continua (so-called “generalized continuum mechanics”, theory of coupled ﬁelds, etc) and approximate or generalized theories of structural members and the associated natural boundary conditions while preparing the way for the full thermomechanical formulation, providing the best setting for the proof of various mathematical theorems, and paving the way for modern numerical methods. The present contribution, illustrated by many examples of varying complexity, emphasizes the role of Paul Germain (1920–2009) in this formulation. The author, himself an active contributor and a never tired propagandist of the method, has participated in these developments during four decades and presents here his witness but critical viewpoint, highlighting the difﬁcult points and also the esthetically pleasing ones where necessary.},

The focus here is on algorithmic and computational aspects of the formulation at ﬁnite strains. The adoption of a logarithmic hyperelastic–plastic formulation preserves the essential features of the inﬁnitesimal formulation. This key ingredient allows the predictor–corrector solution algorithms developed for the inﬁnitesimal gradient formulation to be extended readily to the ﬁnite-strain regime. The use of low-order elements is essential to contain the computational expense of the formulation but these elements are prone to locking. The method of enhanced assumed strains for geometrically nonlinear problems is utilised to circumvent this limitation. The form of the consistent tangent modulus is derived for the case of gradient plasticity. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate aspects of the approximation scheme and the algorithm, as well as features of the model of gradient plasticity.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a modular formulation and computational implementation of a class of anisotropic plasticity models at ﬁnite strains based on incremental minimization principles. The modular kinematic setting consists of a constitutive model in the logarithmic strain space that is framed by a purely geometric pre- and postprocessing. On the theoretical side, the point of departure is an a priori six-dimensional approach to ﬁnite plasticity based on the notion of a plastic metric. In a ﬁrst step, a geometric preprocessor deﬁnes a total and a plastic logarithmic strain measure obtained from the current and the plastic metrics, respectively. In a second step, these strains enter in an additive format a constitutive model of anisotropic plasticity that may have a structure identical to the geometrically linear theory. The model deﬁnes the stresses and consistent tangents work-conjugate to the logarithmic strain measure. In a third step these objects of the logarithmic space are then mapped back to nominal, Lagrangian or Eulerian objects by a geometric postprocessor. This geometric three-step-approach deﬁnes a broad class of anisotropic models of ﬁnite plasticity directly related to counterparts of the geometrically linear theory. It is speciﬁed to a model problem of anisotropic metal plasticity. On the computational side we develop an incremental variational formulation of the above outlined constitutive structure where a quasi-hyperelastic stress potential is obtained from a local constitutive minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this minimization problem is exclusively restricted to the logarithmic strain space in a structure identical to the small-strain theory. The minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for ﬁnite increments of time. We develop a discrete formulation in terms of just one scalar parameter for the amount of incremental ﬂow. The existence of the incremental stress potential provides a natural basis for the deﬁnition of the geometric postprocessor based on function evaluations. Furthermore, the global initialboundary-value-problem of the elastic–plastic solid appears in the incremental setting as an energy minimization problem. Numerical examples show that the results obtained are surprisingly close to those obtained by a reference framework of multiplicative plasticity.},

	abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase ﬁeld. Following our recent work [C. Miehe, F. Welschinger, M. Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent phase ﬁeld models of fracture: Variational principles and multi-ﬁeld fe implementations, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering DOI:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-ﬁeld-type fracture, we propose in this paper a new variational framework for rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the introduction of a local history ﬁeld. It contains a maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation history, which may be considered as a measure for the maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown that this local variable drives the evolution of the crack phase ﬁeld. The introduction of the history ﬁeld provides a very transparent representation of the balance equation that governs the diffusive crack topology. In particular, it allows for the construction of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture. Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split scheme that successively updates in a typical time step the history ﬁeld, the crack phase ﬁeld and ﬁnally the displacement ﬁeld. A regularization based on a viscous crack resistance that even enhances the robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of the phase ﬁeld formulation of fracture by means of representative numerical examples.},

	abstract = {We present hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving steady and timedependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in continuum mechanics. The essential ingredients are a local Galerkin projection of the underlying PDEs at the element level onto spaces of polynomials of degree k to parametrize the numerical solution in terms of the numerical trace; a judicious choice of the numerical ﬂux to provide stability and consistency; and a global jump condition that enforces the continuity of the numerical ﬂux to arrive at a global weak formulation in terms of the numerical trace. The HDG methods are fully implicit, high-order accurate and endowed with several unique features which distinguish themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, they reduce the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the solution on element boundaries, thereby leading to a signiﬁcant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Second, they provide, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of all the variables which converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm. Third, they possess some superconvergence properties that allow us to deﬁne inexpensive element-by-element postprocessing procedures to compute a new approximate solution which may converge with higher order than the original solution. And fourth, they allow for a novel and systematic way for imposing boundary conditions for the total stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the methods. In addition, they possess other interesting properties for speciﬁc problems. Their approximate solution can be postprocessed to yield an exactly divergence-free and H(div)-conforming velocity ﬁeld for incompressible ﬂows. They do not exhibit volumetric locking for nearly incompressible solids. We provide extensive numerical results to illustrate their distinct characteristics and compare their performance with that of continuous Galerkin methods. Ó 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

By exploiting the advantage of mesh flexibility in the VEM, we establish an adaptive mesh refinement strategy based on the superconvergent patch recovery for triangular, quadrilateral as well as for arbitrary polygonal meshes. For the local stiffness matrix in VEM, we adopt a stabilization term which is stable for both isotropic scaling and ratio. Stress intensity factors (SIFs) of a polygonal mesh are discussed and solved by using the interaction domain integral. The present VEM formulations are finally tested and validated by studying its convergence rate for both continuous and discontinuous problems, and are compared with the optimal convergence rate in the conventional Finite Element Method (FEM). Furthermore, the adaptive mesh refinement strategies used to effectively predict the crack growth with the existence of hanging nodes in nonconforming elements are examined.},

	abstract = {A discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the boundary value problem of ﬁnite-deformation elasticity is presented. The primary purpose is to establish a discontinuous Galerkin framework for large deformations of solids in the context of statics and simple material behaviour with a view toward further developments involving behaviour or models where the DG concept can show its superiority compared to the continuous formulation. The method is based on a general Hu–Washizu–de Veubeke functional allowing for displacement and stress discontinuities in the domain interior. It is shown that this approach naturally leads to the formulation of average stress ﬂuxes at interelement boundaries in a ﬁnite element implementation. The consistency and linearized stability of the method in the non-linear range as well as its convergence rate are proven. An implementation in three dimensions is developed, showing that the proposed method can be integrated into conventional ﬁnite element codes in a straightforward manner. In order to demonstrate the versatility, accuracy and robustness of the method examples of application and convergence studies in three dimensions are provided.

	title = {Hybrid {High}-{Order} methods for nonlinear solid mechanics},
	abstract = {In this thesis, we are interested in the devising of Hybrid High-Order (HHO) methods for nonlinear solid mechanics. HHO methods are formulated in terms of face unknowns on the mesh skeleton. Cell unknowns are also introduced for the stability and approximation properties of the method. HHO methods oﬀer several advantages in solid mechanics: (i) primal formulation; (ii) free of volumetric locking due to incompressibility constraints; (iii) arbitrary approximation order k ≥ 1 ; (iv) support of polyhedral meshes with possibly nonmatching interfaces; and (v) attractive computational costs due to the static condensation to eliminate locally cell unknowns while keeping a compact stencil. In this thesis, primal HHO methods are devised to solve the problem of ﬁnite hyperelastic deformations and small plastic deformations. An extension to ﬁnite elastoplastic deformations is also presented within a logarithmic strain framework. Finally, a combination with Nitsche’s approach allows us to impose weakly the unilateral contact and Tresca friction conditions. Optimal convergence rates of order hk+1 are proved in the energy-norm. All these methods have been implemented in both the open-source library disk++ and the open-source industrial software code\_aster. Various two- and three-dimensional benchmarks are considered to validate these methods and compare them with H1-conforming and mixed ﬁnite element methods.},

The method relies cruciallyon a local multiplicativedecomposition of the deformation gradient into a conforming and an enhanced part, formulated in the context of a three-field variational formulation. The resulting class of mixed methods provides a possible extension to the nonlinear regime of well-known incompatible mode formulations. In addition, this class of methods includes non-linear generalizations of recently proposed enhanced strain interpolations for axisymmetric problems which cannot be interpreted as incompatible modes elements. The good performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated in a number of simulations including 2-D, 3-D and axisymmetric finite deformation problems in elasticity and elastoplasticity. Remarkably, these methods appear to be specially well suited for problems involving localization of the deformation, as illustrated in several numerical examples.},

These methods are endowed with several salient features. The equations that deﬁne the numerical scheme are the Euler–Lagrange equations of a oneﬁeld variational principle, a trait that provides an elegant and simple derivation of the method. In consonance with general discontinuous Galerkin formulations, it is possible within this framework to choose different numerical ﬂuxes. Numerical evidence suggests the absence of locking at nearincompressible conditions in the ﬁnite deformations regime when piecewise linear elements are adopted. Finally, a conceivable surprising characteristic is that, as demonstrated with numerical examples, these methods provide a given accuracy level for a comparable, and often lower, computational cost than conforming formulations.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes and analyzes an adaptive stabilization strategy for enhanced strain (ES) methods applied to quasistatic non-linear elasticity problems. The approach is formulated for any type of enhancements or material models, and it is distinguished by the fact that the stabilization term is solution dependent. The stabilization strategy is ﬁrst constructed for general linearized elasticity problems, and then extended to the non-linear elastic regime via an incremental variational principle. A heuristic choice of the stabilization parameters is proposed, which in the numerical examples proved to provide stable approximations for a large range of deformations, different problems and material models. We also provide explicit lower bounds for the stabilization parameters that guarantee that the method will be stable. These are not advocated, since they are generally larger than the ones based on heuristics, and hence prone to deteriorate the locking-free behavior of ES methods. Numerical examples with two different non-linear elastic models in thin geometries and incompressible situations show that the method remains stable and locking free over a large range of deformations. Finally, the method is strongly based on earlier developments for discontinuous Galerkin methods, and hence throughout the paper we offer a perspective about the similarities between the two.

One of the limitations of the continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method (CGFEM) when applied to incompressible elasticity is that the accuracy of the numerical solution may be adversely affected by the phenomenon known as locking—this may prevent the use of a low order polynomial approximation to the displacement on each element. We demonstrate using simulations that the DGFEM presented here does not suffer from this drawback. Two further advantages in this setting of this DGFEM over CGFEMs are that: (i) highly anisotropic meshes—meshes containing elements with a very high aspect ratio—may be used without signiﬁcantly degrading the accuracy of the solution; and (ii) discontinuities in the elasticity parameters are handled more effectively.},

	abstract = {Our goal in this work is to develop and compare modified Newton methods for fully monolithic quasi-static brittle phasefield fracture propagation. In variational phase-field fracture, a smoothed phase-field indicator variable denoting the crack path is coupled to elasticity. Moreover, a crack irreversibility condition is incorporated. To develop a fully monolithic scheme is an extremely challenging task since the underlying problem is non-convex and the Jacobian of Newton’s method is indefinite. To split the problem using alternating minimization, thus a partitioned approach, is a possible resort. However, there are good reasons to consider monolithic approaches such as for example robustness and efficiency. Although an error-oriented Newton method can cope with a larger variety of configurations, it appears that this method is not always robust and also not always efficient. Inspired by nonlinear flow problems, as alternative, we develop a modified Newton scheme in which globalization is based on a dynamic modification of the Jacobian matrix rather than utilizing line-search or trust-region strategies. This variation switches smoothly between full Newton and Newton-like steps. In several 2D and 3D numerical examples, all of them with different characteristic features, our modified Newton solver is compared to a backtracking line-search Newton method, another line-search method monitoring the global energy and allowing for negative curvatures, and to already published results of an error-oriented version. These computations also include further modifications of Newton’s method and detailed discussions why certain schemes either work or fail. Revisiting all findings, the main outcome of this paper is that the modified Newton scheme with Jacobian modification is currently the only method that works in a robust and efficient way for all provided examples, whereas line-search schemes or the error-oriented scheme show deficiencies for certain configurations.},

	abstract = {High-order numerical methods for unstructured grids combine the superior accuracy of high-order spectral or finite difference methods with the geometric flexibility of low-order finite volume or finite element schemes. The Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach unifies various high-order schemes for unstructured grids within a single framework. Additionally, the FR approach exhibits a significant degree of element locality, and is thus able to run efficiently on modern streaming architectures, such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The aforementioned properties of FR mean it offers a promising route to performing affordable, and hence industrially relevant, scale-resolving simulations of hitherto intractable unsteady flows within the vicinity of real-world engineering geometries. In this paper we present PyFR, an open-source Python based framework for solving advection–diffusion type problems on streaming architectures using the FR approach. The framework is designed to solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids containing various element types. It is also designed to target a range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific language based on the Mako templating engine. The current release of PyFR is able to solve the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on grids of quadrilateral and triangular elements in two dimensions, and hexahedral elements in three dimensions, targeting clusters of CPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs. Results are presented for various benchmark flow problems, single-node performance is discussed, and scalability of the code is demonstrated on up to 104 NVIDIA M2090 GPUs.

	abstract = {Despite the versatility in modeling complex crack conﬁgurations, phase-ﬁeld damage models for fracture usually count only one in-house codes, greatly restricting their potential applications. It is thus of vital importance to implement them in those commonly used commercial software packages like Abaqus. However, so far only the less robust Newton’s monolithic algorithm or the inefﬁcient staggered solver has been considered. In this work, taking the uniﬁed phase-ﬁeld damage theory (Wu, 2017) as the particular example, we present three distinct strategies of implementing phase-ﬁeld damage models into Abaqus: (i) UMAT-Newton-M: a thermo-mechanically coupled user-deﬁned material (UMAT) implementation of the modiﬁed Newton monolithic solver; (ii) UEL-Staggered: a novel user-deﬁned element (UEL) implementation of the iterative staggered (alternate minimization) algorithm with dummy dofs; (iii) UEL-BFGS: a UEL implementation of the recently advocated BFGS quasi-Newton monolithic algorithm. The aforesaid implementation strategies are then validated against several representative benchmark problems of brittle fracture and quasi-brittle failure. It is found that, the UMAT-Newton-M implementation is the simplest but not robust enough, while the UEL-Staggered implementation is robust but extremely inefﬁcient. Comparatively, in all cases the UELBFGS scheme is of the best numerical performance with lest iterations and sufﬁcient robustness. For the sake of reproducibility of the presented numerical results and the promotion of phase-ﬁeld damage models, the source codes (programmed in the free format syntax of FORTRAN90) are also provided and interested users can download them at https://github.com/jianyingwu/pfczm-abaqus.},

	abstract = {The major goal of this work is to develop a robust modelling strategy for the simulation of ductile damage development including crack initiation and subsequent propagation. For that purpose, a Gurson‐type model is used. This model class, as many other damage models, leads to significant material softening and must be used within a large deformation framework due to the ductile character of the materials. This leads to 2 main difficulties that should be dealt with carefully: mesh dependency and volumetric locking. In this work, a logarithmic finite strain framework is adopted in which the Gurson‐TvergaardNeedleman constitutive law is reformulated. Then a nonlocal formulation with regularisation of hardening variable is applied so as to solve mesh dependency and strain localization problem. In addition, the nonlocal model is combined with mixed “displacement‐pressure‐volume variation” elements to avoid volumetric locking. Thereby, a mesh‐independent and locking‐free finite strain framework suitable for the modelling of ductile rupture is established. Attention is paid to mathematical properties and numerical performance of the model. Finally, the model parameters are identified on an experimental database for a nuclear piping steel. Simulations of standard test specimens (notched tensile bars and compact tension and single edge notched tensile cracked specimens) are performed and compared to experimental results.},

In this article, we first formulate the quasi-static evolution problem for a general class of such damage models. Then, we introduce a stability criterion in terms of the positivity of the second derivative of the total energy under the unilateral constraint induced by the irreversibility of damage. These concepts are applied in the particular setting of a one-dimensional traction test. We construct homogeneous as well as localized damage solutions in a closed form and illustrate the concepts of loss of stability, of scale effects, of damage localization, and of structural failure. Considering several specific constitutive models, stress—displacement curves, stability diagrams, and energy dissipation provide identification criteria for the relevant material parameters, such as limit stress and internal length. Finally, the 1D analytical results are compared with the numerical solution of the evolution problem in a 2D setting.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the application of the so-called hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to linear elasticity problems. The method has three signiﬁcant features. The ﬁrst is that the only globally coupled degrees of freedom are those of an approximation of the displacement deﬁned solely on the faces of the elements. The corresponding stiffness matrix is symmetric, positive deﬁnite, and possesses a block-wise sparse structure that allows for a very efﬁcient implementation of the method. The second feature is that, when polynomials of degree k are used to approximate the displacement and the stress, both variables converge with the optimal order of k+1 for any k 0. The third feature is that, by using an element-by-element post-processing, a new approximate displacement can be obtained that converges at the order of k +2, whenever k 2. Numerical experiments are provided to compare the performance of the HDG method with that of the continuous Galerkin (CG) method for problems with smooth solutions, and to assess its performance in situations where the CG method is not adequate, that is, when the material is nearly incompressible and when there is a crack.

A simple postprocessing is introduced which takes advantage of the special structure of the method. It allows us to construct an approximation to the displacement which is H(div)-conforming and to enforce the equation that links the pressure to the divergence of the displacement strongly inside each element. As a consequence, when the material is exactly incompressible, the displacement is also exactly incompressible. This is achieved without having to deal with the almost impossible task of constructing ﬁnite dimensional subspaces of incompressible displacements. We provide an error analysis of the method that holds uniformly with respect to the Poisson ratio. In particular, we show that the displacement converges in L2 with order k + 1 when polynomials of degree k {\textgreater} 0 are used. We also display numerical experiments conﬁrming that the theoretical orders of convergence are actually achieved and that they do not deteriorate when the material becomes incompressible.},

	abstract = {In the extended finite element method (XFEM), errors are caused by parasitic terms in the approximation space of the blending elements at the edge of the enriched subdomain. A discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation is developed, which circumvents this source of error. A patch-based version of the DG formulation is developed, which decomposes the domain into enriched and unenriched subdomains. Continuity between patches is enforced with an internal penalty method. An element-based form is also developed, where each element is considered a patch. The patch-based DG is shown to have similar accuracy to the element-based DG for a given discretization but requires significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The method is applied to material interfaces, cracks and dislocation problems. For the dislocations, a contour integral form of the internal forces that only requires integration over the patch boundaries is developed. A previously developed assumed strain (AS) method is also developed further and compared with the DG method for weak discontinuities and linear elastic cracks. The DG method is shown to be significantly more accurate than the standard XFEM for a given element size and to converge optimally, even where the standard XFEM does not. The accuracy of the DG method is similar to that of the AS method but requires less application-specific coding. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The extended finite element method (XFEM) enables the representation of cracks in arbitrary locations of a mesh. We introduce here a variant of the XFEM rendering an optimally convergent scheme. Its distinguishing features are as follows: (a) the introduction of singular asymptotic crack tip fields with support on only a small region around the crack tip (the enrichment region), (b) only one and two enrichment functions are added for anti-plane shear and planar problems, respectively and (c) the relaxation of the continuity between the enrichment region and the rest of the domain, and the adoption of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method therein. The method is provably stable for any positive value of a stabilization parameter, and by weakly enforcing the continuity between the two regions it eliminates ‘blending elements’ partly responsible for the suboptimal convergence of some early XFEMs. Moreover, the particular choice of enrichment functions results in a surprisingly sparse stiffness matrix that remains reasonably conditioned as the mesh is refined. More importantly, the stress intensity factors can be extracted with a satisfactory accuracy as primary unknowns. Quadrature strategies required for the optimal convergence are also discussed. Finally, the DG method was modified to retain stability based on an inf-sup condition. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {We prove the optimal convergence of a discontinuous-Galerkin-based extended finite element method for two-dimensional linear elastostatic problems over cracked domains. The method, which we proposed earlier [1], has two distinctive traits: a) it enriches the finite element space with the modes I and II singular asymptotic crack tip fields over a neighborhood of the crack tip termed the enrichment region, and b) it allows functions in the finite element space to be discontinuous across the boundary between the enrichment region and the rest of the domain. The treatment for this discontinuity, generally a non-polynomial function, is facilitated by a specially designed discontinuous Galerkin method based on the Bassi–Rebay numerical flux. The stability of the method is contingent upon an inf–sup condition, which we have proved to hold for any quasiuniform mesh family with sufficiently fine meshes. We have also shown the optimal convergence of the displacement and stress fields, and the convergence of the stress intensity factors extracted as the coefficients of the enrichment functions.},

The scheme is based on a semi-explicit temporal discretization with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the Stokes operator. The nonlinear term is discretized in divergence form by using the local Lax–Friedrichs ﬂuxes; thus, local conservativity is inherent. Spatial discretization of the Stokes operator has employed both equal-order (Pk À Pk) and mixed-order (Pk À PkÀ1) velocity and pressure approximations. A second-order approximate algebraic splitting is used to decouple the velocity and pressure calculations leading to an algebraic Helmholtz equation for each component of the velocity and a consistent Poisson equation for the pressure. The consistent Poisson operator is replaced by an equivalent (in stability and convergence) operator, namely that arising from the interior penalty discretization of the standard Poisson operator with appropriate boundary conditions. This yields a simpler and more eﬃcient method, characterized by a compact stencil size.},

First, we express the approximate scalar variable and corresponding ﬂux within each element in terms of an approximate trace of the scalar variable along the element boundary. We then deﬁne a unique value for the approximate trace by enforcing the continuity of the normal component of the ﬂux across the element boundary; a global equation system solely in terms of the approximate trace is thus obtained. The high number of globally coupled degrees of freedom in the discontinuous Galerkin approximation is therefore signiﬁcantly reduced. If the problem is time-dependent, we discretize the time derivative by means of backward difference formulae. This results in efﬁcient schemes capable of producing high-order accurate solutions in space and time. Indeed, when the time-marching method is ðp þ 1Þth order accurate and when polynomials of degree p P 0 are used to represent the scalar variable, the ﬂux and the approximate trace, we observe that the approximations for the scalar variable, the ﬂux and the trace of the scalar variable converge with the optimal order of p þ 1 in the L2-norm. Finally, we introduce a simple element-by-element postprocessing scheme to obtain new approximations of the ﬂux and the scalar variable. The new approximate ﬂux, which has a continuous inter-element normal component, is shown to converge with order p þ 1 in the L2-norm. The new approximate scalar variable is shown to converge with order p þ 2 in the L2-norm. For the time-dependent case, the postprocessing does not need to be applied at each time-step but only at the times for which an enhanced solution is required. Moreover, the postprocessing procedure is less expensive than the solution procedure, since it is performed at the element level.

	abstract = {We present an implicit high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the steady-state and time-dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The method is devised by using the discontinuous Galerkin discretization for a velocity gradient-pressure–velocity formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with a special choice of the numerical traces. The method possesses several unique features which distinguish itself from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, it reduces the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the velocity and the mean of the pressure on element boundaries, thereby leading to a signiﬁcant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Moreover, if the augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the linearized system, the globally coupled unknowns become the approximate trace of the velocity only. Second, it provides, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of the velocity, pressure, and velocity gradient which converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm, when polynomials of degree kP0 are used for all components of the approximate solution. And third, it displays superconvergence properties that allow us to use the above-mentioned optimal convergence properties to deﬁne an element-by-element postprocessing scheme to compute a new and better approximate velocity. Indeed, this new approximation is exactly divergence-free, H (div)-conforming, and converges with order k + 2 for k P 1 and with order 1 for k = 0 in the L2-norm. Moreover, a novel and systematic way is proposed for imposing boundary conditions for the stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the method. This can be done on different parts of the boundary and does not result in the degradation of the optimal order of convergence properties of the method. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy properties of the method for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and for various polynomial degrees.},

We introduce a continuous mapping between a ﬁxed reference conﬁguration and the time-varying domain. By writing the Navier–Stokes equations as a conservation law for the independent variables in the reference conﬁguration, the complexity introduced by variable geometry is reduced to solving a transformed conservation law in a ﬁxed reference conﬁguration. The spatial discretization is carried out using the Discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured meshes of triangles, while the time integration is performed using an explicit Runge–Kutta method. For general domain changes, the standard scheme fails to preserve exactly the free-stream solution which leads to some accuracy degradation, especially for low order approximations. This situation is remedied by adding an additional equation for the time evolution of the transformation Jacobian to the original conservation law and correcting for the accumulated metric integration errors. A number of results are shown to illustrate the ﬂexibility of the approach to handle high-order approximations on complex geometries.},

              We develop an arbitrary-order primal method for diffusion problems on general polyhedral meshes.
The degrees of freedom are scalar-valued polynomials of the same order at mesh elements and faces.
The cornerstone of the method is a local (elementwise) discrete gradient reconstruction operator.
The design of the method additionally hinges on a least-squares penalty term on faces weakly enforcing the matching between local element- and face-based degrees of freedom.
The scheme is proved to optimally converge in the energy norm and in the

              -norm of the potential for smooth solutions.
In the lowest-order case, equivalence with the Hybrid Finite Volume method is shown.
The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments up to order 4 on several polygonal meshes.},

We show under general assumptions the existence of a discrete solution, which is also unique provided a data smallness condition is veriﬁed. Using a compactness argument, we prove convergence of the sequence of discrete solutions to minimal regularity exact solutions for general data. For more regular solutions, we prove optimal convergence rates for the energy-norm of the velocity and the L2-norm of the pressure under a standard data smallness assumption. More precisely, when polynomials of degree k ≥ 0 at mesh elements and faces are used, both quantities are proved to converge as hk+1 (with h denoting the meshsize).},

In this work, the attention is focused on those formulations approximating mode II fractures (shear fractures). In these models, only the deviatoric part of the strain elastic energy, penalized by the phase-field, drives the crack onset and evolution, whereas the elastic hydrostatic energetic contribution has no influence on the failure process. Consequently, cracks evolves according to the von Mises–Hencky–Hüber, also known as J2, failure criterion. Unfortunately, volumetric locking problem arises in the damaged zones if classical numerical solution strategies are adopted. As a consequence, damage localization bands appear with an excessive thickness, thus overestimating the fracture energy. In addition, the crack path geometry may be erroneously described because of the loss of precision of the displacement field in damaged zones. To circumvent these drawbacks, two numerical techniques are proposed, namely selective reduced integration and mixed displacement/pressure formulation, and their effectiveness evidenced by a numerical investigation.},

Such a framework is not only well-suited to the mathematical study of the boundary value problem, but also leads in a natural way to an ecient numerical algorithm. The formulation is ®rst presented, then applied to several classes of models existing in the literature : a homogenization-based constitutive relation, a porosity model and gradient plasticity.

To retrieve a well-posed problem, the material state is described through the gradients of damage in addition to the strain and the damage. Under some assumptions, it is shown that these gradient laws can be cast into a variational formulation. Its numerical treatment is reduced to the design of a mixed finite element so that algorithms such as Newton’s method and path-following techniques are still available. Possible convergence difficulties related to the reduction of the damage band width and the appearance of micro instabilities are removed thanks to the design of a new class of brittle laws. Finally, numerical applications show the convergence with mesh refinement, the compatibility with coarser approaches such as Griffith’s theory and cohesive crack models, the robustness in case of unstable multi-cracking, the applicability to full-scale 3D situations and the physical relevance compared to experimental data.},

Various general results of the literature on the constitutive modeling and on the response of a solid under a given loading are revisited in this unified description. The quasi-static response is governed by a variational inequality which is an alternative form of Biot equation. A full discussion of this evolution equation is given in terms of the energy and dissipation potentials of the solid. The rate problem and the rate variational principle are considered and compared to the incremental problem and the incremental variational principle which result from an implicit discretization of the evolution equations. In particular, rate and incremental minimum principles are related to a stability condition.},

This bypasses the need to implement explicitly the weak form resultant from the coupling between the momentum conservation and the evolution of the diffusive field. Throughout benchmarking examples, the proposed methodology is assessed and validated by investigating typical issues risen from the considered local inelastic-based deformation models, such as mesh dependency and the difficulties to predict cracked regions.},

In this work, the attention is focused on those formulations approximating mode II fractures (shear fractures). In these models, only the deviatoric part of the strain elastic energy, penalized by the phase-field, drives the crack onset and evolution, whereas the elastic hydrostatic energetic contribution has no influence on the failure process. Consequently, cracks evolves according to the von Mises–Hencky–Hüber, also known as J2, failure criterion. Unfortunately, volumetric locking problem arises in the damaged zones if classical numerical solution strategies are adopted. As a consequence, damage localization bands appear with an excessive thickness, thus overestimating the fracture energy. In addition, the crack path geometry may be erroneously described because of the loss of precision of the displacement field in damaged zones. To circumvent these drawbacks, two numerical techniques are proposed, namely selective reduced integration and mixed displacement/pressure formulation, and their effectiveness evidenced by a numerical investigation.},

	abstract = {A micromorphic formulation of the phase-field model of martensitic transformation is developed within the incremental energy minimization framework. In contrast to the conventional phase-field formulation, the order parameters are viewed as local variables and the corresponding evolution equations are solved at the material-point level, i.e. at the Gauss points in the finite-element setting. From a computational standpoint, such a treatment is advantageous for complex evolution laws that may lead to computational difficulties if treated globally, as in the conventional phase-field formulation. In the micromorphic formulation, each order parameter is coupled to its micromorphic counterpart governed by a global Helmholtz-type PDE. This coupling ensures that the interfacial energy and related size effects are correctly captured by the model. In this work, the micromorphic approach is applied to a finite-strain multivariant phase-field model that incorporates rate-independent dissipation. The augmented Lagrangian technique is then used to transform the resulting non-smooth incremental minimization problem to a smooth and unconstrained saddle-point problem. Microstructure evolution under nano-indentation is studied to illustrate the approach.},

	abstract = {The construction of regularization operators presented in this work is based on the introduction of strain or damage micromorphic degrees of freedom in addition to the displacement vector and of their gradients into the Helmholtz free energy function of the constitutive material model. The combination of a new balance equation for generalized stresses and of the micromorphic constitutive equations generates the regularization operator. Within the small strain framework, the choice of a quadratic potential w.r.t. the gradient term provides the widely used Helmholtz operator whose regularization properties are well known: smoothing of discontinuities at interfaces and boundary layers in hardening materials, and finite width localization bands in softening materials. The objective is to review and propose nonlinear extensions of micromorphic and strain/damage gradient models along two lines: the first one introducing nonlinear relations between generalized stresses and strains; the second one envisaging several classes of finite deformation model formulations. The generic approach is applicable to a large class of elastoviscoplastic and damage models including anisothermal and multiphysics coupling. Two standard procedures of extension of classical constitutive laws to large strains are combined with the micromorphic approach: additive split of some Lagrangian strain measure or choice of a local objective rotating frame. Three distinct operators are finally derived using the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. A new feature is that a free energy function depending solely on variables defined in the intermediate isoclinic configuration leads to the existence of additional kinematic hardening induced by the gradient of a scalar micromorphic variable.},

	abstract = {Despite the popularity in modeling complex and arbitrary crack configurations in solids, phase-field damage models suffer from burdensome computational cost. This issue arises largely due to the robust but inefficient alternating minimization (AM) or staggered algorithm usually employed to solve the coupled damage–displacement governing equations. Aiming to tackle this difficulty, we propose in this work, for the first time, to use the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm to solve in a monolithic manner the system of coupled governing equations, rather than the standard Newton one which is notoriously poor for problems involving non-convex energy functional. It is found that, the BFGS algorithm yields identical results to the AM/staggered solver, and is also robust for both brittle fracture and quasi-brittle failure with a single or multiple cracks. However, much less iterations are needed to achieve convergence. Furthermore, as the system matrix is less reformed per increment, the quasi-Newton monolithic algorithm is much more efficient than the AM/staggered solver. Representative numerical examples show that the saving in CPU time is about factor 3∼7, and the larger the problem is, the more saving it gains. As the BFGS monolithic algorithm has been incorporated in many commercial software packages, it can be easily implemented and is thus attractive in the phase-field damage modeling of localized failure in solids.},

	abstract = {Despite the versatility in modeling complex crack configurations, phase-field damage models for fracture usually count only on in-house codes, greatly restricting their potential applications. It is thus of vital importance to implement them in those commonly used commercial software packages like Abaqus. However, so far only the less robust Newton’s monolithic algorithm or the inefficient staggered solver has been considered. In this work, taking the unified phase-field damage theory (Wu, 2017) as the particular example, we present three distinct strategies of implementing phase-field damage models into Abaqus: (i) UMAT-Newton-M: a thermo-mechanically coupled user-defined material (UMAT) implementation of the modified Newton monolithic solver; (ii) UEL-Staggered: a novel user-defined element (UEL) implementation of the iterative staggered (alternate minimization) algorithm with dummy dofs; (iii) UEL-BFGS: a UEL implementation of the recently advocated BFGS quasi-Newton monolithic algorithm. The aforesaid implementation strategies are then validated against several representative benchmark problems of brittle fracture and quasi-brittle failure.

	abstract = {The PLEIADES software environment is devoted to the thermomechanical simulation of nuclear fuel elements behaviour under irradiation. This platform is co-developed in the framework of a research cooperative program between Électricité de France (EDF), AREVA and the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). As many thermomechanical solvers are used within the platform, one of the PLEAIADES’s main challenge is to propose a unified software environment for capitalisation of material knowledge coming from research and development programs on various nuclear systems. This paper introduces a tool called mfront which is basically a code generator based on C++ (Stroustrup and Eberhardt, 2004). Domain specific languages are provided which were designed to simplify the implementations of new material properties, mechanical behaviours and simple material models. mfront was recently released under the GPL open-source licence and is available on its web site: http://tfel.sourceforge.net/. The authors hope that it will prove useful for researchers and engineers, in particular in the field of solid mechanics. mfront interfaces generate code specific to each solver and language considered. In this paper, after a general overview of mfront functionalities, a particular focus is made on mechanical behaviours which are by essence more complex and may have significant impact on the numerical performances of mechanical simulations. mfront users can describe all kinds of mechanical phenomena, such as viscoplasticity, plasticity and damage, for various types of mechanical behaviour (small strain or finite strain behaviour, cohesive zone models). Performance benchmarks, performed using the Code\_Aster finite element solver, show that the code generated using mfront is in most cases on par or better than the behaviour implementations written in fortran natively available in this solver. The material knowledge management strategy that was set up within the PLEIADES platform is briefly discussed. A material database named sirius proposes a rigorous material verification workflow. We illustrate the use of mfront through two case of studies: a simple FFC single crystal viscoplastic behaviour and the implementation of a recent behaviour for the fuel material which describes various phenomena: fuel cracking, plasticity and viscoplasticity.},

	abstract = {To model the mechanical response of rate-dependent elasto-viscoplastic (or equivalently non-linear viscoelastic) particulate composites, the proposed approach consists in linearizing the (nonlinear) relation between the viscous strain rate and the stress. To obtain a tractable problem, the linearized properties (viscous modulus, stress-free strain rate) are chosen uniform per phase: in each phase, they are computed for reference stresses per phase. Thus, we obtain a fictitious linear viscoelastic solid whose microstructure is the same as the previous one and submitted to additional uniform stress-free strains per phase. For two-phases isotropic particulate composites, this general formulation associated to Hashin-Shtrikman estimates of the above-mentioned fictitious linear viscoelastic solid yields closed-form expressions of the time evolution of the effective behavior as well as phase-averaged mechanical fields expressed as a set of nonlinear first-order differential equations. Since the linearized properties in the matrix phase are based on the second-order moment of the stress field, these estimates coincides with the upper bound in the purely viscoplastic regime. These estimates are also consistent with the one given for non aging linear viscoelastic composites (correspondence principle). Finally, full-field computations are used to asses the quality of these estimates for various loading conditions varying from a pure shear to a pure differential swelling loading for moderate to highly contrasted behaviors and including non monotonic and non radial effects.},

Noticing that the collocation method is usually adopted to invert the Laplace–Carson transforms, we first remark that this approximation is equivalent to an internal variables formulation which is exact in some specific situations. This result is illustrated for a two-phase composite with phases obeying a compressible maxwellian behaviour. Next, an incremental formulation allows to extend at each time step the previous general framework to ageing viscoelasticity. Finally, with the help of a creep test of a porous viscoelastic matrix reinforced with elastic inclusions, it is shown that the method yields accurate predictions (comparing to reference results provided by periodic cell finite element computations).},

The HHO methods use as discrete unknowns piecewise polynomials of order k≥1k≥1k{\textbackslash}textbackslashge 1 on the mesh skeleton, together with cell-based polynomials that can be eliminated locally by static condensation. The discrete problem is written as the minimization of a broken nonlinear elastic energy where a local reconstruction of the displacement gradient is used. Two HHO methods are considered: a stabilized method where the gradient is reconstructed as a tensor-valued polynomial of order k and a stabilization is added to the discrete energy functional, and an unstabilized method which reconstructs a stable higher-order gradient and circumvents the need for stabilization. Both methods satisfy the principle of virtual work locally with equilibrated tractions. We present a numerical study of the two HHO methods on test cases with known solution and on more challenging three-dimensional test cases including finite deformations with strong shear layers and cavitating voids. We assess the computational efficiency of both methods, and we compare our results to those obtained with an industrial software using conforming finite elements and to results from the literature. The two HHO methods exhibit robust behavior in the quasi-incompressible regime.},

	abstract = {Cette thèse a pour objectif de développer une modélisation robuste pour l’endommagement ductile. En raison de l’adoucissement et du niveau de déformation élevé, les principales difficultés pratiques dans la simulation de l’endommagement ductile sont la dépendance au maillage et le verrouillage volumique. Dans ce travail, on choisit tout d’abord le cadre de grandes déformations en se basant sur un formalisme logarithmique. Puis, partant de la loi de Gurson-Tvergaard- Needleman transcrite en grandes déformations, on adopte une formulation non locale à gradient d’une variable interne qui permet de contrôler la localisation du dommage et traiter ainsi la dépendance au maillage. Ensuite, le modèle non local est couplé avec des éléments finis mixtes pour limiter le verrouillage volumique relatif à l’incompressibilité plastique. On aboutit ainsi à la construction d’un cadre de modélisation de l’endommagement ductile, indépendant du maillage et exonéré du verrouillage volumique. Les propriétés mathématiques et la performance numérique du modèle sont étudiées avec attention. Enfin, après une identification des paramètres sur un acier nucléaire, on réalise des simulations sur des éprouvettes (AE, CT, SENT) et sur une tuyauterie de réelle dimension afin de les confronter à des résultats d’essais.},

	abstract = {Les simulations en mécanique du solide présentent des difficultés comme le traitement de l'incompressibilité ou les non-linéarités dues aux grandes déformations, aux lois de comportement et de contact. L'objectif principal de ce travail est de proposer des méthodes éléments finis capables de gérer l'incompressibilité en grandes déformations en utilisant des éléments de faible ordre. Parmi les approches de la littérature, les formulations mixtes offrent un cadre théorique intéressant. Dans ce travail, une formulation mixte à trois champs (déplacements, pression, gonflement) est introduite. Dans certains cas, cette formulation peut être condensée en formulation à deux champs. Cependant, il est connu que le problème discret obtenu par une approche éléments finis de type Galerkin n'hérite pas automatiquement de la condition de stabilité “inf-sup” du problème continu : les éléments finis utilisés, et notamment les ordres d'interpolation doivent être choisis de sorte à vérifier cette condition de stabilité. Cependant, il est possible de s'affranchir de cette contrainte en ajoutant des termes de stabilisation à la formulation EF Galerkin. Cette approche permet entre autres d'utiliser des ordres d'interpolation égaux. Dans ce travail, des éléments finis stables de type P2/P1 sont utilisés comme référence, et comparés à une formulation P1/P1, stabilisée soit avec une fonction bulle, soit avec une méthode VMS (Variational Multi-Scale) basée sur un espace sous-grille orthogonal à l'espace EF. Combinées à un modèle grandes déformations basé sur des déformations logarithmiques, ces approches sont d'abord validées sur des cas académiques puis sur des cas industriels.},

	abstract = {Le travail de thèse porte sur la fissuration des pastilles combustible UO2 des réacteurs à eau pressurisée, et ses conséquences sur le comportement mécanique du crayon combustible. La fissuration conduit : d’une part, à une importante relaxation des contraintes dont dépendent la plupart des autres phénomènes mécaniques et physicochimiques, d’autre part, à la fragmentation de la pastille. Sa prise en compte est nécessaire pour une description correcte du chargement mécanique de la gaine au cours de l’irradiation. L’approche locale de la rupture a été adoptée pour décrire la fissuration de la pastille. Des considérations pratiques nous ont amenés à privilégier une description quasi-statique de la fissuration du combustible à l’aide de modèles d’endommagement local. Ces modèles décrivent l’apparition de fissures par une perte de rigidité locale du matériau. Une telle description présente des difficultés de mise en oeuvre, telles que des dépendances des résultats au maillage éléments finis et des évolutions discontinues de l’équilibre de la structure lors de propagations instables. Ces points ont fait l’objet d’une attention particulière car ils conditionnent l’utilisation de tels modèles dans les études combustibles. Le travail effectué s’inscrit en support des différents schémas de calculs du code ALCYONE développé au DEC/SESC au sein de la plateforme PLEIADES. Pour chacun de ces schémas, qui se différencient par les hypothèses de modélisation géométrique du crayon, nous avons proposé une modélisation des effets de la fissuration de la pastille. La modélisation dite 2D axisymétrique du crayon combustible est la plus novatrice et a été de ce fait particulièrement étudiée.

La zone High Burnup Structure (HBS) des combustibles fortement irradiés est la plus susceptible de se fragmenter et d’être relocalisée par sa position en périphérie de pastille.

La teneur en matière fissile y étant différente, ces phases évoluent différemment sous irradiation, tant du point de vue mécanique que du point de vue chimique. Pour modéliser correctement le comportement macroscopique du combustible MOX dans un code de calcul industriel, les modèles ont besoin d'être alimentés de façon pertinente en propriétés effectives, mais il est aussi intéressant de disposer d'informations sur les champs locaux afin d'établir des couplages entre les mécanismes (couplage mécanique physico-chimie). L'objectif de la thèse fut donc de développer une modélisation par changement d'échelles, basée sur l'approche NTFA (Michel et Suquet 2003). Ces développements ont été réalisés sur des microstructures tridimensionnelles (3D) représentatives du combustible MOX et pour un comportement local visco-élastique vieillissant avec déformations libres. Dans un premier temps, pour représenter le combustible MOX en 3D nous avons utilisé des méthodes existantes pour traiter et segmenter les images expérimentales 2D, puis nous avons remonté les informations 2D indispensables (fuseau diamétral des inclusions et fractions surfaciques respectives) en 3D par la méthode stéréologique de Saltykov (Saltykov 1967) et enfin nous avons développé des outils pour représenter et discrétiser un composite multiphasé particulaire, type MOX.},

Pour cela, on doit notamment connaître (et si possible maîtriser) les propriétés viscoplastiques du combustible. Le but de cette thèse a été de caractériser le fluage du dioxyde d’uranium dans des conditions de transitoires de puissance de centrale nucléaire. Nous nous sommes intéressés aux résultats disponibles dans la littérature sur le comportement mécanique du dioxyde d'uranium UO2. Ce sont essentiellement des essais de compression qui ont permis de caractériser le fluage de la céramique nucléaire, et qui ont prouvé que le fluage du dioxyde d'uranium est caractérisé par deux types comportement, en fonction du niveau de contraintes appliqué. Pour évaluer les sollicitations dans la pastille combustible, EDF ou CEA ont développé des codes de calcul spécifiques, dit globaux. Partant d’un de ces calculs lors des transitoires de puissance, nous avons dégagé les ordres de grandeur des sollicitations vues par le combustible (température, gradients thermiques, déformations, vitesses de déformations,…). Le calcul des contraintes lors de transitoires de puissance nécessite l’identification de lois de comportement capables de décrire le comportement de la céramique pour de faibles taux de déformation e,t notamment, sous des contraintes de traction. Partant de ce constat nous avons choisi de caractériser le comportement du dioxyde d’uranium en flexion. Le cahier des charges de cette étude imposant de prélever les échantillons directement dans les pastilles, ceci dans un souci de représentativité, l’entraxe de sollicitation a été fixé à 10 mm. Pour cette étude nous avons donc développé un dispositif spécifique de flexion trois points pouvant atteindre 2000°C sous atmosphère contrôlée (Ar + 5\%H2). Une attention particulière a été portée sur la mesure de la flèche ; elle est assurée par un extensomètre à ombrage laser dédié, d'une résolution de ± 2 µm à haute température. En utilisant ce dispositif, nous avons testé en fluage des éprouvettes d’épaisseur 0,5 à 1 mm. Dans nos conditions d'essai, le fluage stationnaire a pu être décrit à l’aide d'une loi de Norton avec un exposant de contrainte de 1,73 et une énergie d'activation de 540 kJ.mole-1. Nous avons ensuite modélisé le comportement mécanique du combustible : l’introduction de variables internes dans une loi à écrouissage cinématique a permis de représenter l'ensemble des courbes de fluage et les phénomènes de recouvrance de la déformation présentés lors de déchargements partiels. L’identification a été réalisée par méthode inverse, couplant optimisation des paramètres et calcul par éléments finis des déformations de l'éprouvette de flexion. L'application de cette loi dans un calcul de transitoire de puissance démontre que les capacités de relaxation du matériau ne permettent pas de prévenir une rupture radiale du combustible en fin de montée de puissance. Lors du maintien à puissance élevée, la température élevée à cœur autorise une diminution des contraintes, notamment près des évidements. Il en résulte un écoulement de matière principalement axial, clairement confirmé par l'observation de pastilles usagées. L'application finale de notre dispositif expérimental a été de tester des éprouvettes implantées aux ions, sur une profondeur de 50µm. La faible épaisseur de nos échantillons a permis de mettre en évidence l’effet de l’irradiation sur le fluage de UO2.},

Pellet samples were tested at four temperatures (1100, 1350, 1550 and 1700 ° C ) and at a strain rate varying over 4 decades ( 10 - 4 – 10 - 3 – 10 - 2 – 10 - 1 /s). The experimental results show that the stress–strain curves cannot be fitted with a unique power law as it is the case at smaller strain rates ( 10 - 9 – 10 - 5 /s). A strain-hardening also appears in most of the tests. The microstructural observations show a pronounced evolution of the porosity at the pellet center during the tests. A hyperbolic sine model which accounts for volume variations (pore compressibility) was therefore proposed to describe the behavior of UO2 on a large range of temperatures ( 1100 - 1700 ° C ) and strain rates ( 10 - 9 – 10 - 1 /s). The Finite Element simulations of the compression tests lead to results (maximum stress, axial and hoop strain distribution, porosity distribution) in good agreement with the measurements. The model was then assessed on a database of more than two hundred creep tests.},

The yield stress was found to increase with strain rate and to decrease with temperature. Macroscopic cracking of the samples was apparent after the tests at 1100 °C. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image analyses revealed a pronounced grain boundary cracking in the core of the samples tested at 10 - 1 /s and at 1550–1700 °C. A hyperbolic sine model for the viscoplastic strain rate with a clear dependency on porosity was first developed. It was completed by a Drucker–Prager yield criterion with associated plastic flow to account for the porosity increase induced by grain boundary cracking. Finite Elements simulations of the compression tests on the dense UO2 were then successfully compared to the stress–strain curves, post-test diameter profiles and porosities at the pellets’ center, periphery and top extremity. The response of the grain boundary cracking model was then studied in biaxial compression, this condition being closer to that of the pellet during a RIA power transient.},

The overall behavior of these types of composite materials is obtained with the help of quadratic strain-rate potentials combined with experimental-based coupling function depending on stress and temperature. For each creeping mechanism, the hollow sphere model of [Michel, J.-C., Suquet, P., 1992. The constitutive law of nonlinear viscous and porous materials.

Mechanical parameters of the resulting model are identified and validated in the particular case of non-irradiated uranium dioxide nuclear ceramics.

	abstract = {This paper focuses on a new algorithm for the quasi-static simulation of unstable crack propagation in time-independent brittle material. The proposed approach is based on a combination of the standard Newton’s algorithm with a fictive path loading algorithm. First, a time step refinement process, associated to the Newton’s algorithm, enables us to efficiently detect the beginning of unstable crack extension. Then, a fictive path loading algorithm is performed to assess an estimation of the post instability solution. Finally, this estimated solution is used as initial guess in the standard Newton’s algorithm for the same time increment. The final converged solution satisfies both the mechanical equilibrium and the mechanical behaviour integration. This paper highlights several advantages of the proposed algorithm such as robustness, easy implementation on an existing Newton’s type solver, genericity for different unstable nonlinear physical problems. An application of this new method is presented for a smeared crack model, based on a local continuous damage formulation, devoted to the simulation of brittle nuclear fuel rupture. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a set of 2d and 3d simulation results.},

To this purpose, an extension of the algorithm used in TRANSURANUS was proposed and verified adopting different solution methods: an analytic solution and finite element calculations by means of COMSOL. In particular, creep calculations were carried out applying a Norton law that defines cladding creep strains under varying stress conditions. The verification against the numerical solution given by COMSOL and the analytic solution shows an excellent agreement of the radial profiles of stresses and strains. The new code was applied to the simulation of cladding ballooning tests, and to an integral LOCA test of the FUMEX-III project. The impact of the new algorithm on the predicted time-to-burst and clad strain was assessed pointing out the effect of different failure criteria.},

The data are further interpreted in a continuum mechanics, finite strain framework, in both one and two–dimensional geometries, whence stress and oxygen partial pressure exponents of the creep law are estimated. The stress exponent is indicative of power–law creep. The oxygen partial pressure exponent is consistent with a strain–rate limited by vacancy mediated self–diffusion of the slowest moving ion, suggesting a climb–controlled recovery process.

Over the past ten years, the ability of the phase-field approach to also possibly describe and predict crack nucleation has been under intense investigation. The first of two objectives of this paper is to establish that the existing phase-field approach to fracture at large — irrespectively of its particular version — cannot possibly model crack nucleation. This is so because it lacks one essential ingredient: the strength of the material. The second objective is to amend the phase-field theory in a manner such that it can model crack nucleation, be it from large pre-existing cracks, small pre-existing cracks, smooth and non-smooth boundary points, or within the bulk of structures subjected to arbitrary quasistatic loadings, while keeping undisturbed the ability of the standard phase-field formulation to model crack propagation. The central idea is to implicitly account for the presence of the inherent microscopic defects in the material — whose defining macroscopic manifestation is precisely the strength of the material — through the addition of an external driving force in the equation governing the evolution of the phase field. To illustrate the descriptive and predictive capabilities of the proposed theory, the last part of this paper presents sample simulations of experiments spanning the full range of fracture nucleation settings.},

	abstract = {Brittle and ductile dynamic fracture in solids is a complex mechanical phenomenon which attracted much attention from both engineers and scientists due to its technological interests. Modeling cracks in dynamic cases based on a discontinuous description is difficult because it needs additional criteria for branching and widening. Due to the very short time scales and the spatial complexity of the dynamic problem, its experimental analysis is still very difficult. Therefore, researchers still have to rely on numerical simulations to find a deeper explanation for many observed phenomena. This study is set out to investigate the effect of plasticity on dynamic fracture propagation. On the other hand, the diffuse phase-field formulation makes it possible to initiate, propagate, arrest or even branch cracks while satisfying the basic principles of thermodynamics. An implicit, staggered elastoplastic version of the phase-field approach was implemented in the commercial finite element code Abaqus through the UEL option. By means of simple examples we show that localized ductile deformations first increase both resistance and toughness. Then, after a maximum value, the resistance starts to decrease with a significant increment in energy dissipation. By favoring shear deformation over tensile failure the fracture pattern changes. First the branching disappears, then the crack propagation angle changes and becomes a shear band. Finally, we observed the increment of the instantaneous dynamic stress intensity factor during the acceleration stage of the crack without introducing a rate dependent critical fracture energy. We explained this phenomenon with the increasing roughness of the fracture surface.},

The method is dedicated to voxel-based models of highly complex microstructures, as obtained from X-ray microtomography images. A smoothed displacement jump approximation is introduced by means of level-set functions to overcome the issue of pixelized interfaces in voxel-based models. A simple technique is proposed to construct the level-set function in that case. Compared to recent work aiming at modeling cohesive cracks within the phase field method, our framework differs in several points: the formulation is such that interfaces are not initially damaged; no additional variables are required to describe the discontinuities at the interface and fatigue cracks can be modeled. The technique allows interaction between bulk and interface cracks, e.g. nucleation from interfaces and propagation within the matrix, and for arbitrary geometries and interactions between cracks. Several benchmarks are presented to validate the model. The technique is illustrated through numerical examples involving complex microcracking in X-ray CT image-based models of concrete microstructures.},

If its value reaches one the material is fully broken, thus both its stiffness and stress are reduced to zero. The elastic displacement and the fracture problem are decoupled and solved separately as a staggered solution. The approach does not need predefined cracks and it can simulate curvilinear fracture paths, branching and even crack coalescence.

	abstract = {Our goal in this work is to develop and compare modified Newton methods for fully monolithic quasi-static brittle phase-field fracture propagation. In variational phase-field fracture, a smoothed phase-field indicator variable denoting the crack path is coupled to elasticity. Moreover, a crack irreversibility condition is incorporated. To develop a fully monolithic scheme is an extremely challenging task since the underlying problem is non-convex and the Jacobian of Newton’s method is indefinite. To split the problem using alternating minimization, thus a partitioned approach, is a possible resort. However, there are good reasons to consider monolithic approaches such as for example robustness and efficiency. Although an error-oriented Newton method can cope with a larger variety of configurations, it appears that this method is not always robust and also not always efficient. Inspired by nonlinear flow problems, as alternative, we develop a modified Newton scheme in which globalization is based on a dynamic modification of the Jacobian matrix rather than utilizing line-search or trust-region strategies. This variation switches smoothly between full Newton and Newton-like steps. In several 2D and 3D numerical examples, all of them with different characteristic features, our modified Newton solver is compared to a backtracking line-search Newton method, another line-search method monitoring the global energy and allowing for negative curvatures, and to already published results of an error-oriented version. These computations also include further modifications of Newton’s method and detailed discussions why certain schemes either work or fail. Revisiting all findings, the main outcome of this paper is that the modified Newton scheme with Jacobian modification is currently the only method that works in a robust and efficient way for all provided examples, whereas line-search schemes or the error-oriented scheme show deficiencies for certain configurations.},

The model is a strongly nonlinear non-convex variational inequality that demands the resolution of small length scales. The current standard algorithm for its solution, alternate minimization, is robust but converges slowly and demands the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear subproblems. In this paper, we propose several advances in the numerical solution of this model that improve its computational efficiency. We reformulate alternate minimization as a nonlinear Gauss–Seidel iteration and employ over-relaxation to accelerate its convergence; we compose this accelerated alternate minimization with Newton's method, to further reduce the time to solution, and we formulate efficient preconditioners for the solution of the linear subproblems arising in both alternate minimization and in Newton's method. We investigate the improvements in efficiency on several examples from the literature; the new solver is five to six times faster on a majority of the test cases considered. © 2016 The Authors International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

To enforce crack irreversibility as a constraint, we use a primal-dual active set strategy, which can be identified as a semi-smooth Newton method. The active set iteration is merged with the Newton iteration for solving the fully-coupled nonlinear partial differential equation discretized using finite elements, resulting in a single, rapidly converging nonlinear scheme. It is well known that phase-field models require fine meshes to accurately capture the propagation dynamics of the crack. Because traditional estimators based on adaptive mesh refinement schemes are not appropriate, we develop a predictor-corrector scheme for local mesh adaptivity to reduce the computational cost. This method is both robust and efficient and allows us to treat temporal and spatial refinements and to study the influence of model regularization parameters. Finally, our proposed approach is substantiated with different numerical tests for crack propagation in elastic media and pressurized fracture propagation in homogeneous and heterogeneous media.},

We focus on the linear elastic case where the contact condition appears as a local unilateral constraint on the displacement jump at the crack surfaces. The regularized model is obtained by splitting the strain energy in a spherical and a deviatoric parts and accounting for the sign of the local volume change. The numerical implementation is based on a standard finite element discretization and on the adaptation of an alternate minimization algorithm used in previous works. The new regularization avoids crack interpenetration and predicts asymmetric results in traction and in compression. Even though we do not exhibit any gamma-convergence proof toward the desired limit behavior, we illustrate through several numerical case studies the pertinence of the new model in comparison to other approaches.},

	abstract = {Les modèles d'endommagement à gradient, aussi dénommés modèles à champs de phases, sont désormais largement utilisés pour modéliser la rupture fragile et ductile, depuis l'initiation de l'endommagement jusqu'à la propagation d'une fissure. Cependant, la majorité des études disponibles dans la littérature ne concerne que le cadre des petites déformations, et très peu d'études poussées ont été menées afin d'étudier leur pertinence dans un contexte de grandes déformations. Ce serait pourtant d'un intérêt primordial, notamment pour l'industrie pneumatique, qui deviendrait alors capable de prédire plus précisément l'initiation de l'endommagement dans ses structures.Dans la première partie de ce travail, nous établissons des solutions analytiques d'évolution de l'endommagement (homogène et localisée) pour des matériaux visqueux, en petites et en grandes déformations. En petites déformations, les modèles rhéologiques de Maxwell et Poynting-Thomson sont étudiés, et en grandes déformations, les modèles de Maxwell et Zener sont choisis. Une étude sur l'évolution de l'endommagement dans un cas purement hyperélastique est aussi menée.A cette première partie analytique succède une partie numérique, qui détaille l'implémentation des modèles d'endommagement à gradient dans des codes éléments finis en grandes déformations. De même qu'en petites déformations, une stratégie de minimisation alternée est adoptée pour résoudre successivement les problèmes d'endommagement et de déplacement. Le matériau suit une loi de Mooney-Rivlin quasi-incompressible, et une méthode mixte en déplacement-pression est utilisée. Des tests en 2D et 3D sont effectués, qui mettent en évidence la capacité des modèles à initier de l'endommagement en grandes déformations.Les modèles d'endommagement utilisés pour la seconde partie ne sont cependant capables d'initier de l'endommagement que dans les zones où la déformation est importante, c'est-à-dire dans les zones de forte contrainte déviatorique. Il a toutefois été montré que certains matériaux polymères, quasi-incompressibles, s'endommagent dans les zones de forte pression hydrostatique. Par conséquent, la recherche et l'étude d'un modèle d'endommagement capable d'initier de l'endommagement dans les zones de forte pression, pour des matériaux quasi-incompressibles lorsqu'ils sont sains, fait l'objet d'une troisième partie.Enfin, la croissance brusque de cavités dans un matériau hyperélastique, appelée phénomène de cavitation, est étudiée, ainsi que son interaction avec l'endommagement. Dans un premier temps, nous considérons la cavitation comme une simple bifurcation hyperélastique d'un matériau néo-hookéen compressible isotrope, et déterminons l'expression analytique de l'élongation critique pour laquelle la cavitation fait son apparition. Dans un second temps, nous montrons qu'il y a une compétition entre la cavitation et l'endommagement, et qu'en fonction de la valeur du ratio des élongations critiques respectives pour chaque phénomène, deux types de rupture apparaissent.},

We propose a framework that encompasses most of these non-local approaches.

It allows a systematic exploration of the properties of these models. We focus here on three aspects: the existence of solutions when applied to strain-hardening laws, the effective localisation control when applied to strain-softening laws and the thermodynamic bases. A quite extended analysis is led under some assumptions, the more restrictive being that all the internal variables are dealt with the same regularising operator. It appears that only few approaches bring effective regularisation. Unfortunately, they do not rely on thermodynamic bases so that the Clausius–Duhem inequality is not automatically fulfilled. An alternative consists in giving up the assumptions of the analysis. In that case, it seems that no general result can be stated. Moreover, an illustration in the context of brittle damage shows that slightly different formulations can result in strongly differentiated behaviour, even though some specific choices lead nevertheless to a suitable model.},

	abstract = {A rate-independent damage constitutive law is proposed to describe the fracture of plain concrete under tensile loading. Here, the target scale is the individual crack. In order to deal with localised damage, the model is inherently nonlocal: the gradient of the damage field is explicitly involved in the constitutive equations; it is parameterised by a nonlocal length scale which is interpreted as the width of the process zone. The model is defined so that its predictions are close to those of a cohesive law for vanishing nonlocal length scales. Therefore, the current model is plainly consistent with cohesive zone model analyses: the nonlocal length scale appears as a small parameter which does not need any specific identification. And four parameters—among which the tensile strength and the fracture energy—enable to adjust the softening cohesive response. Besides, a special attention has been paid to the shape of the initial damage surface and to the relation between damage and stiffness. The damage surface takes into account not only the contrast between tensile and compressive strengths but also experimental evidences regarding its shape in multiaxial tension. And the damage–stiffness relation is defined so as to describe important phenomena such as the stiffness recovery with crack closure and the sustainability of compressive loads by damaged structures. Finally, several comparisons with experimental data (global force/opening responses, size dependency, curved crack paths, crack opening profiles) enable to validate qualitatively and quantitatively the pertinence of the constitutive law in 2D and 3D.},

	abstract = {A variational formulation is proposed for a family of elastic–plastic–damage models within the framework of rate-independent materials. That consists first in defining the total energy which contains, in particular, a gradient damage term and a term which represents the plastic dissipation but depends also on damage. Then, the evolution law is deduced from the principles of irreversibility, stability and energy balance. Accordingly, the plastic dissipation term which appears both in the damage criterion and the plastic yield criterion plays an essential role in the damage–plasticity coupling. Suitable constitutive choices on how the plastic yield stress decreases with damage, allows us to obtain a rich variety of coupled responses. A particular attention is paid on the equations which govern the formation of cohesive cracks where the displacement is discontinuous and the plasticity localizes. In the one-dimensional traction test where the solution is obtained in a closed form, we show that, because of damage localization, a cohesive crack really appears at the center of the damage zone before the rupture and the associated cohesive law is obtained in closed form in terms of the constitutive parameters. A Finite Element discrete version of the energy functional is used to simulate a two-dimensional traction test over a rectangular domain with mixed boundary conditions; again a localized band of plastic strain is generated seemingly independent of the mesh size.},

This paper presents a novel efficient and robust phase field algorithm for quasi-static brittle fracture analysis. This algorithm overcomes two major issues that affect significantly the numerical cost of the method: the treatment of discontinuous crack propagation and the inequality constraint associated with the irreversibility of the damage evolution. To handle discontinuous crack propagation, a semi-implicit scheme, which combines the usual explicit and implicit schemes, is proposed. Different from explicit schemes that require small time steps and purely implicit schemes that lose immediately efficiency when encountering discontinuous propagation, the proposed method can alleviate the steps constraint while keeping a good robustness with discontinuous cracking. Concerning the irreversibility constraint, this work proposes a practical and easy-to-implement method. It is shown that this method is extremely efficient and robust without any supplementary numerical coefficient. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by means of representative numerical examples.},

Irreversibility of the crack phase-field imposed to prevent fracture healing leads to a constrained minimization problem, whose optimality condition is given by a variational inequality. In our study, the irreversibility is handled via penalization. Provided the penalty constant is well-tuned, the penalized formulation is a good approximation to the original one, with the advantage that the induced equality-based weak problem enables a much simpler algorithmic treatment. We propose an analytical procedure for deriving the optimal penalty constant, more precisely, its lower bound, which guarantees a sufficiently accurate enforcement of the crack phase-field irreversibility. Our main tool is the notion of the optimal phase-field profile, as well as the Γ-convergence result. It is shown that the explicit lower bound is a function of two formulation parameters (the fracture toughness and the regularization length scale) but is independent of the problem setup (geometry, boundary conditions etc.), the formulation ingredients (degradation function, tension–compression split etc.), as well as the discretization (mesh size). The optimally-penalized formulation is tested for three benchmark problems, including one with available analytical solution. We also compare our results with those obtained by using the alternative irreversibility technique based on the notion of the history field by Miehe et al. (2010).},

	abstract = {A macroscopic theory is proposed to describe, explain, and predict the nucleation and propagation of fracture and healing in elastomers undergoing arbitrarily large quasistatic deformations. The theory, which can be viewed as a natural generalization of the phase-field approximation of the variational theory of brittle fracture of Francfort and Marigo (1998) to account for physical attributes innate to elastomers that have been recently unveiled by experiments at high spatio-temporal resolution, rests on two central ideas. The first one is to view elastomers as solids capable to undergo finite elastic deformations and capable also to phase transition to another solid of vanishingly small stiffness: the forward phase transition serves to model the nucleation and propagation of fracture while the reverse phase transition models the possible healing. The second central idea is to take the phase transition to be driven by the competition between a combination of strain energy and hydrostatic stress concentration in the bulk and surface energy on the created/healed new surfaces in the elastomer. From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving a system of two coupled and nonlinear PDEs for the deformation field and an order parameter, or phase field. A numerical scheme is presented to generate solutions for these PDEs in N=2 and 3 space dimensions. This is based on an efficient non-conforming finite-element discretization, which remains stable for large deformations and elastomers of any compressibility, together with an implicit gradient flow solver, which is able to deal with the large changes in the deformation field that can ensue locally in space and time from the nucleation of fracture. The last part of this paper is devoted to presenting sample simulations of the so-called Gent–Park experiment. Those are confronted with recent experimental results for various types of silicone elastomers.},

	abstract = {The ALCYONE multidimensional fuel performance code co-developed by the CEA, EDF and AREVA NP within the PLEIADES software environment models the behavior of fuel rods during irradiation in commercial Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs), power ramps in experimental reactors or accidental conditions such as Loss Of Coolant Accidents (LOCAs) or Reactivity-Initiated Accidents (RIAs). As regards the latter case of transient in particular, ALCYONE is intended to predictively simulate the response of a fuel rod by taking account of mechanisms as close to physics as possible, encompassing all possible stages of the transient as well as various fuel/cladding material types and irradiation conditions of interest. On the way to complying with these objectives, its development and validation shall include tests on PWR-UO 2 fuel rods with advanced claddings such as M5® under " low pressure-low temperature " or " high pressure-high temperature " water coolant conditions. This paper first presents the ALCYONE V1.4 RIA-related features and modeling. It especially focuses on recent developments dedicated on the one hand to non steady water heat and mass transport and on the other hand to the modeling of grain boundary cracking-induced fission gas release and swelling. This paper then compares some simulations of RIA transients performed on UO 2-M5® fuel rods in flowing sodium or stagnant water coolant conditions to the relevant experimental results gained from tests performed in either the French CABRI or the Japanese NSRR nuclear transient reactor facilities. It shows in particular to what extent ALCYONE – starting from base irradiation conditions it itself computes – is currently able to handle both the first stage of the transient, namely the Pellet Cladding Mechanical Interaction (PCMI) phase, and the second stage of the transient, should the boiling crisis occur. Areas of improvement are finally discussed with a view to simulating and analyzing further tests to be performed under prototypical PWR conditions within the CABRI International Program.

	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02418148},
	abstract = {The industrial fission gas behavior model CARACAS developed and validated for LWR-UO2 fuels in different fuel performance codes at CEA, EDF and AREVA is now being adapted to simulate the behavior of fuels with complex microstructures. In the current industrial licensed code, the description of such fuel is based on homogenization of the pellet, whereas for CEA's fuel performance code ALCYONE, this microstructure can be modelled by inclusions surrounded by a continuous matrix. The main objectives of the CARACAS fission gas model are to propose a continuous approach in both steady-state and off-normal conditions, but also to make it depend on the initial microstructure of the material. To model the fission gas behavior in such a complex microstructure, we assume that the behavior of each phase can be modeled as a homogeneous phase. First, neutron model provides CARACAS model the average local power rate, fission density and xenon/krypton production in each phase. Then, in CARACAS model, the first way of coupling between phases is done by the fission gas production mechanism, in which the recoil of fission gas atoms and their implantation from one phase to the other is taken into account. This heterogeneity of fission distribution and fission gas atoms production leads also to a heterogeneous swelling of the material, and so to a heterogeneous distribution of stress in the microstructure.It is now possible to take into account the heterogeneity of stress induced by this heterogeneous swelling and its feedback on the fission gas behavior model, thanks to the micro-mechanical behavior law. As the fission gas behavior model (particularly the gaseous swelling and the intragranular/intergranular gas distribution) depends at first order on the hydrostatic stress, the distribution of stress in the microstructure is very important. As this approach is very time-consuming, it is more dedicated to research applications or to very specific design calculations such as refined accidental initializations. For standard industrial applications, some simplifications are done. Depending on the representation of the microstructure in the fuel performance code where the model is implemented, different hypothesis are presented homogeneous or heterogeneous. Comparison of calculated results in both configurations with experimental data is also presented. An attempt of uncertainty quantification in relation to experimental conditions of the validation database is also performed.},

A fictitious hydride blister of increasing depth (25 to 90\% of the clad thickness) is introduced at the beginning of the calculation. When a pre-determined hoop stress is exceeded at the clad outer surface, radial cracking of the blister is taken into account in the simulation by a modification of the mechanical boundary conditions. The hoop stress criterion is based on Finite Element simulations of laboratory hoop tensile tests performed on highly irradiated samples with a through-wall hydride blister. The response of the remaining clad ligament (beneath the cracked blister) to the pellet thermal expansion is then studied. The simulations show that plastic strains localize in a band orientated at ∼45° to the radial direction, starting from the blister crack tip and ending at the clad inner wall. This result is in good agreement with the ductile shear failures of the clad ligaments observed post-RIA transients. Based on a local plastic strain failure criterion in the shear band, ALCYONE simulations are then used to define the enthalpy at failure in function of the blister depth.},

	title = {Recent modelling improvements in fuel performance code {GERMINAL} for {SFR} oxide fuel pins},
	abstract = {To support the design studies of ASTRID, the future technological Sodium Fast Reactor demonstrator in France, the modelling of mixed oxide fuel pins has been improved by developing a new version of GERMINAL fuel performance code within PLEIADES simulation framework. GERMINAL V2 is using a standard « 1D1⁄2 » representation of the fuel pin. Thermal analysis and mechanics are now based on finite elements computations. The fuel pellet is considered as a continuum, with a mechanical behaviour model managing element elimination during the central hole formation. The expansion due to cracking during heat-up, and later the free volumes closure between the fragments, are described by two imposed strain terms. By solving the fuel / cladding system equilibrium, we intend to evaluate the mechanical interaction, which can become significant, and the stresses induced by swelling gradients in the cladding thickness. Off-normal conditions are simulated by a strong coupling of thermal-hydraulics in the coolant with the thermal analysis of the fuel pin. A new neutronics scheme has also been developed, integrating progressively the evolutions of volatile fission products. Their release at high burn-up causes the “Joint Oxyde-Gaine” formation between pellet and cladding. With a refined prediction of the JOG composition, we intend to improve the evaluation of heat exchange inside gap at high burn-up, and also the description of cladding corrosion. Helium production has already been completed, to simulate fuel pins loaded with minor actinides. All these evolutions implemented in GERMINAL V2 are being validated by simulating fuel elements irradiated in PHENIX or in CABRI reactor. We are considering objects from different geometries, with various cladding materials, burn-ups and irradiation histories. The comparisons of the calculation results with the experimental data show the current abilities and limits of the code, and consequently the working perspectives we have.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fuel operates in an environment that induces complex multiphysics phenomena, occurring over distances ranging from inter-atomic spacing to meters, and times scales ranging from microseconds to years. This multiphysics behavior is often tightly coupled and many important aspects are inherently multidimensional. Most current fuel modeling codes employ loose multiphysics coupling and are restricted to 2D axisymmetric or 1.5D approximations. This paper describes a new modeling tool able to simulate coupled multiphysics and multiscale fuel behavior, for either 2D axisymmetric or 3D geometries. Specific fuel analysis capabilities currently implemented in this tool are described, followed by a set of demonstration problems which include a 10-pellet light water reactor fuel rodlet, three-dimensional analysis of pellet clad mechanical interaction in the vicinity of a defective fuel pellet, coupled heat transfer and fission product diffusion in a TRISO-coated fuel particle, a demonstration of the ability to couple to lower-length scale models to account for material property variation with microstructural evolution, and a demonstration of the tool’s ability to efficiently solve very large and complex problems using massively-parallel computing. A final section describes an early validation exercise, comparing simulation results to a light water reactor fuel rod experiment.},

Doing so requires taking into account the coupled effects of heat transfer, the mechanical interaction between the fuel and its surrounding protection, the isotopic evolution caused by the irradiation, and the chemical interactions between fuel, fission products, cladding, and coolant. In view of the strong interactions between the various aspects of fuel performance and the resulting mathematical problems, the simulation of the fuel behavior requires fuel performance codes, which are being used by safety authorities, research organizations, and fuel vendors. The basic equations for each aspect of the codes are described in this chapter, together with the specific features of and modeling requirements for the design basis accident analysis. Finally, this chapter also outlines the advanced issues and future needs of fuel performance codes for nuclear fuel rods based on oxides.},

Here, this formulation is altered by combining it with structured deformation theory, to model that when the material microstructure is loosened and damaged, peculiar inelastic (structured) deformations may occur in the representative volume element at the price of surface energy consumption. This approach unifies various theories of failure because, by simply varying the form of the class for admissible structured deformations, different-in-type responses can be captured, incorporating the idea of cleavage, deviatoric, combined cleavage-deviatoric and masonry-like fractures. Remarkably, this latter formulation rigorously avoid material overlapping in the cracked zones. The model is numerically implemented using a standard finite-element discretization and adopts an alternate minimization algorithm, adding an inequality constraint to impose crack irreversibility (fixed crack model). Numerical experiments for some paradigmatic examples are presented and compared for various possible versions of the model.},

The HHO methods use as discrete unknowns piecewise polynomials of order k ≥ 1 on the mesh skeleton, together with cell-based polynomials that can be eliminated locally by static condensation. The discrete problem is written as the minimization of a broken nonlinear elastic energy where a local reconstruction of the displacement gradient is used. Two HHO methods are considered: a stabilized method where the gradient is reconstructed as a tensor-valued polynomial of order k and a stabilization is added to the discrete energy functional, and an unstabilized method which reconstructs a stable higher-order gradient and circumvents the need for stabilization. Both methods satisfy the principle of virtual work locally with equilibrated tractions. We present a numerical study of the two HHO methods on test cases with known solution and on more challenging three-dimensional test cases including ﬁnite deformations with strong shear layers and cavitating voids. We assess the computational efﬁciency of both methods, and we compare our results to those obtained with an industrial software using conforming ﬁnite elements and to results from the literature.

	abstract = {This work addresses an efficient low order virtual element method (VEM) for the phase-field modeling of isotropic brittle fracture. Virtual elements were introduced in the last decade and applied to various problems in solid mechanics. The phase-field approach regularizes sharp crack surfaces within a pure continuum setting by a specific gradient damage modeling with constitutive terms rooted in fracture mechanics, see Miehe et al. [23] and Miehe et al. [29]. In the presented contribution, we propose a rigorous variational-based framework for the phase-field modeling of brittle fracture in elastic solids undergoing small strains. The key goal here, is the extension towards the recently developed virtual element formulation due to the flexible choice of nodes number in an element which can be changed easily during the simulation process, as outlined in Wriggers et al. [11] and Wriggers et al. [18]. To this end, the potential density is formulated in terms of suitable polynomial functions, instead of computing the unknown shape functions for complicated element geometries, e.g. arbitrary convex or concave polygonal elements. An important aspect of this work is the introduction of an incremental minimization principle, with a novel construction of the stabilization density for the coupled multi-field problem. On the computational side, a robust and efficient monolithic scheme is employed using the software tool ACEFEM program in the numerical implementation to compute the unknowns (displacement and crack phase-field), see Korelc and Wriggers [52]. The performance of the formulation is underlined by means of representative examples.},

	abstract = {A variational formulation is proposed for a family of elastic–plastic–damage models within the framework of rate-independent materials. That consists ﬁrst in deﬁning the total energy which contains, in particular, a gradient damage term and a term which represents the plastic dissipation but depends also on damage. Then, the evolution law is deduced from the principles of irreversibility, stability and energy balance. Accordingly, the plastic dissipation term which appears both in the damage criterion and the plastic yield criterion plays an essential role in the damage–plasticity coupling. Suitable constitutive choices on how the plastic yield stress decreases with damage, allows us to obtain a rich variety of coupled responses. A particular attention is paid on the equations which govern the formation of cohesive cracks where the displacement is discontinuous and the plasticity localizes. In the one-dimensional traction test where the solution is obtained in a closed form, we show that, because of damage localization, a cohesive crack really appears at the center of the damage zone before the rupture and the associated cohesive law is obtained in closed form in terms of the constitutive parameters. A Finite Element discrete version of the energy functional is used to simulate a two-dimensional traction test over a rectangular domain with mixed boundary conditions; again a localized band of plastic strain is generated seemingly independent of the mesh size.},

Revisiting brittle fracture as an energy minimization problem. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 46 (8), 1319–1342]. We focus on the linear elastic case where the contact condition appears as a local unilateral constraint on the displacement jump at the crack surfaces. The regularized model is obtained by splitting the strain energy in a spherical and a deviatoric parts and accounting for the sign of the local volume change. The numerical implementation is based on a standard ﬁnite element discretization and on the adaptation of an alternate minimization algorithm used in previous works. The new regularization avoids crack interpenetration and predicts asymmetric results in traction and in compression. Even though we do not exhibit any gamma-convergence proof toward the desired limit behavior, we illustrate through several numerical case studies the pertinence of the new model in comparison to other approaches.},

The screened-Poisson equation is employed to relate the kinematic Green-Lagrange strain with the mixed strain. The strain vector obtained from the face normals is now a (vector) degree-of-freedom at each face. In contrast with variational multiscale methods, there are no parameters to ﬁt and stability in compression is veriﬁed. When compared with smoothed ﬁnite-elements, the formulation is straightforward and sparsity pattern of the classical system retained, albeit with high computational cost. In contrast with traditional gradient-enhanced formulations, a theoretically sound mixed formulation underlies the algorithm. High accuracy is obtained for four-node tetrahedra with incompressibility and bending benchmarks being solved. Traditional ﬁnite-strain benchmarks and a quasi-brittle damage numerical test are performed, with very competitive results.},

This requires the development of a compatible pair of ﬁnite element spaces, one to discretize the space of symmetric tensors in which the stress ﬁeld is sought, and one to discretize the space of vector ﬁelds in which the displacement is sought. Although there are number of well-known mixed ﬁnite element pairs known for the analogous problem involving vector ﬁelds and scalar ﬁelds, the symmetry of the stress ﬁeld is a substantial additional difﬁculty, and the elements presented here are the ﬁrst ones using polynomial shape functions which are known to be stable. We present a family of such pairs of ﬁnite element spaces, one for each polynomial degree, beginning with degree two for the stress and degree one for the displacement, and show stability and optimal order approximation. We also analyze some obstructions to the construction of such ﬁnite element spaces, which account for the paucity of elements available.},

Thanks to the freedom in deﬁning the mesh topology, we propose a new h-adaptive technique based on agglomeration coarsening of a ﬁne mesh. The possibility to enhance the error distribution over the computational domain is investigated on a Poisson problem with the goal of obtaining a mesh independent discretization. The main building block of our dG method consists of deﬁning discrete polynomial spaces directly on physical frame elements. For this purpose we orthonormalize with respect to the L2-product a set of monomials relocated in a speciﬁc element frame and we introduce an easy way to reduce the cost related to numerical integration on agglomerated meshes. To complete the dG formulation for second order problems, two extensions of the BR2 scheme to arbitrary polyhedral grids, including an estimate of the stabilization parameter ensuring the coercivity property, are here proposed.},

	abstract = {The present paper aims at modeling complex fracture phenomena where different damaging mechanisms are involved. For this purpose, the standard one-variable phase-field/gradient damage model, able to regularize Griffith’s isotropic brittle fracture problem, is extended to describe different degradation mechanisms through several distinct damage variables. Associating with each damage variable a different dissipated fracture energy, the coupling between all mechanisms is achieved through the degradation of the elastic stiffness. The framework is very general and can be tailored to many situations where different fracture mechanisms are present as well as to model anisotropic fracture phenomena. In this first work, after a general presentation of the model, the attention is focused on a specific paradigmatic case, namely the brittle fracture problem of a 2D homogeneous orthotropic medium with two different damaging mechanisms with respect to the two orthogonal directions. Illustrative numerical applications consider propagation in mode I and II as well as kinking of cracks as a result of a transition between the two fracture mechanisms. It is shown that the proposed model and numerical implementation compares well with theoretical and experimental results, allowing to reproduce specific features of crack propagation in anisotropic materials whereas standard models using one damage variable seem unable to do so.},

Mathematically this quantity appears as dual to the displacement of the molecule with regard to the medium ; iv Lagrange variables, it is analogue to a mass force expressing the influence of the extorior. This force is shown to act only on the points where the medium is elastically inhomogeneous (inclusion, crack, plastified zone...). The study is made for any particular position, eventually a very deformed one. The vectorial sum of these forces in a given volume is calculated with the help of an integral stretched to the surface which limits this volume. This integral generalises the Rice integral which had only been written in the case of the approximation of small deformations.},

Both methods support polyhedral meshes with nonmatching interfaces and are based on a combination of the hybrid high-order (HHO) method and Nitsche’s method. Since HHO methods involve both cell unknowns and face unknowns, this leads to different formulations of Nitsche’s consistency and penalty terms, either using the trace of the cell unknowns (cell version) or using directly the face unknowns (face version). The face version uses equal-order polynomials for cell and face unknowns, whereas the cell version uses cell unknowns of one order higher than the face unknowns. For Dirichlet conditions, optimal error estimates are established for both versions. For Signorini conditions, optimal error estimates are proven only for the cell version. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and also reveal optimal convergence for the face version applied to Signorini conditions.},

For the later issue, we provide a new stabilization scheme that is based on the trace of the material tangent modulus tensor, which captures highly heterogeneous and localized deformations. Two VEM formulations are presented: a two-field mixed and an equivalent displacement-based, which is free of volumetric locking. Convergence and accuracy of the VEM formulations are verified by means of numerical examples, and engineering applications are demonstrated.},

Cell-based unknowns, which can be eliminated locally by a Schur complement technique (also known as static condensation), are also used in the formulation. Salient examples of high-order Discontinuous Skeletal methods are Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin methods and the recently-devised Hybrid High-Order methods. Some major benefits of Discontinuous Skeletal methods are that their construction is dimensionindependent and that they offer the possibility to use general meshes with polytopal cells and non-matching interfaces. In this work, we show how this mathematical flexibility can be efficiently replicated in a numerical software using generic programming. We describe a number of generic algorithms and data structures for high-order Discontinuous Skeletal methods within a ‘‘write once, run on any kind of mesh’’ framework. The computational efficiency of the implementation is assessed on the Poisson model problem discretized using various polytopal meshes and the Hybrid High-Order method.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review and reﬁne the main ideas for devising the so-called hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods; we do that in the framework of steady-state diffusion problems. We begin by revisiting the classic techniques of static condensation of continuous ﬁnite element methods and that of hybridization of mixed methods, and show that they can be reinterpreted as discrete versions of a characterization of the associated exact solution in terms of solutions of Dirichlet boundary-value problems on each element of the mesh which are then patched together by transmission conditions across interelement boundaries. We then deﬁne the HDG methods associated to this characterization as those using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to approximate the local Dirichlet boundary-value problems, and using weak impositions of the transmission conditions. We give simple conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of their approximate solutions, and show that, by their very construction, the HDG methods are amenable to static condensation. We do this assuming that the diffusivity tensor can be inverted; we also brieﬂy discuss the case in which it cannot. We then show how a different characterization of the exact solution, gives rise to a different way of statically condensing an already known HDG method. We devote the rest of the paper to establishing bridges between the HDG methods and other methods (the old DG methods, the mixed methods, the staggered DG method and the so-called Weak Galerkin method) and to describing recent efforts for the construction of HDG methods (one for systematically obtaining superconvergent methods and another, quite different, which gives rise to optimally convergent methods). We end by providing a few bibliographical notes and by brieﬂy describing ongoing work.},

The distinctive feature of the methods in this framework is that the only globally coupled degrees of freedom are those of an approximation of the solution deﬁned only on the boundaries of the elements. Since the associated matrix is sparse, symmetric and positive deﬁnite, these methods can be eﬃciently implemented. Moreover, the framework allows, in a single implementation, the use of diﬀerent methods in diﬀerent elements or subdomains of the computational domain which are then automatically coupled. Finally, the framework brings about a new point of view thanks to which it is possible to see how to devise novel methods displaying very localized and simple mortaring techniques, as well as methods permitting an even further reduction of the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom.},

The advantage of virtual elements is the ductility that easily allows high order accuracy and high order continuity.},

The proof hinges on the classical Dupont–Scott approximation theory together with two novel abstract lemmas: An approximation result for bounded projectors, and an [Formula: see text]-boundedness result for [Formula: see text]-orthogonal projectors on polynomial subspaces. The [Formula: see text]-approximation results have general applicability to (standard or polytopal) numerical methods based on local polynomial spaces. As an illustration, we use these [Formula: see text]-estimates to derive novel error estimates for a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) discretisation of Leray–Lions elliptic problems whose weak formulation is classically set in [Formula: see text] for some [Formula: see text]. This kind of problems appears, e.g. in the modelling of glacier motion, of incompressible turbulent flows, and in airfoil design. Denoting by [Formula: see text] the meshsize, we prove that the approximation error measured in a [Formula: see text]-like discrete norm scales as [Formula: see text] when [Formula: see text] and as [Formula: see text] when [Formula: see text].},

After reviewing some fundamentals of isogeometric analysis, we investigate the use of higher-order Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) within the B¯ projection method. The higher-continuity property of such functions is explored in nearly incompressible applications and shown to produce accurate and robust results. A new nonlinear F¯ projection method, based on a modiﬁed minimum potential energy principle and inspired by the B¯ method is proposed for the large-deformation case. It leads to a symmetric formulation for which the consistent linearized operator for fully nonlinear elasticity is derived and used in a Newton-Raphson iterative procedure. The performance of the methods is assessed on several numerical examples, and results obtained are shown to compare favorably with other published techniques.},

The current standard algorithm for its solution, alternate minimization, is robust but converges slowly and demands the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear subproblems. In this paper, we propose several advances in the numerical solution of this model that improve its computational efﬁciency. We reformulate alternate minimization as a nonlinear Gauss–Seidel iteration and employ over-relaxation to accelerate its convergence; we compose this accelerated alternate minimization with Newton’s method, to further reduce the time to solution, and we formulate efﬁcient preconditioners for the solution of the linear subproblems arising in both alternate minimization and in Newton’s method. We investigate the improvements in efﬁciency on several examples from the literature; the new solver is ﬁve to six times faster on a majority of the test cases considered. © 2016 The Authors International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {A unifying thermomechanical framework is presented that reconciles several classes of gradient elastoviscoplasticity and damage models proposed in the literature during the last 40 years. It is based on the introduction of the micromorphic counterpart ␹␾ of a selected state or internal variable ␾ in a standard constitutive model. In addition to the classical balance of momentum equation, a balance of micromorphic momentum is derived that involves generalized stress tensors. The corresponding additional boundary conditions are also deduced from the procedure. The power of generalized forces is assumed to contribute to the energy balance equation. The free energy density function is then chosen to depend on a relative generalized strain, typically ␾-␹␾, and the microstrain gradient ١␹␾. When applied to the deformation gradient itself, ␾ ϵ F{\textbackslash}textgreater , the method yields the micromorphic theory of Eringen and Mindlin together with its extension to ﬁnite deformation elastoviscoplasticity by Forest and Sievert. If the selected variable is the cumulative plastic strain, the theory reduces to the so-called “nonlocal implicit gradient-enhanced elastoplasticity model” by Engelen, Geers, and Peerlings, provided that simpliﬁed linear relationships are adopted between generalized stresses and strains. The same holds if the micromorphic variable coincides with a microdamage variable. If the internal constraint is introduced that the micromorphic variable ␹␾ remains as close as possible to the macroscopic variable ␾, the micromorphic model reduces to the second gradient or gradient of internal variable approach as deﬁned by Maugin. If the selected variable is the cumulative plastic strain or the full plastic strain tensor, the constrained micromorphic theory delivers Aifantis-like strain gradient plasticity models. The advantage of the micromorphic approach is that it provides the generalized balance equation under nonisothermal conditions and offers the setting for anisotropic nonlinear constitutive relations between generalized stress and strains in contrast to most existing models. In rate-independent plasticity, it is shown that there is generally no need for a variational formulation of the yield condition.},

While volume-locking is a well-known problem that can be dealt with in many diﬀerent discretization approaches, the concept of gradient-robustness for linear elasticity is new. We discuss both aspects and propose novel Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for linear elasticity. The starting point for these methods is a divergence-conforming discretization. As a consequence of its well-behaved Stokes limit the method is gradient-robust and free of volume-locking. To improve computational eﬃciency, we additionally consider discretizations with relaxed divergence-conformity and a modiﬁcation which re-enables gradientrobustness, yielding a robust and quasi-optimal discretization also in the sense of HDG superconvergence.},

	abstract = {Irreversible evolution is one of the central concepts as well as implementation challenges of both the variational approach to fracture by Francfort and Marigo (1998) and its regularized counterpart by Bourdin, Francfort and Marigo (2000, 2007 and 2008), which is commonly referred to as a phase-field model of brittle fracture. Irreversibility of the crack phase-field imposed to prevent fracture healing leads to a constrained minimization problem, whose optimality condition is given by a variational inequality. In our study, the irreversibility is handled via penalization. Provided the penalty constant is well-tuned, the penalized formulation is a good approximation to the original one, with the advantage that the induced equality-based weak problem enables a much simpler algorithmic treatment. We propose an analytical procedure for deriving the optimal penalty constant, more precisely, its lower bound, which guarantees a sufficiently accurate enforcement of the crack phase-field irreversibility. Our main tool is the notion of the optimal phase-field profile, as well as the Γ -convergence result. It is shown that the explicit lower bound is a function of two formulation parameters (the fracture toughness and the regularization length scale) but is independent of the problem setup (geometry, boundary conditions etc.), the formulation ingredients (degradation function, tension–compression split etc.), as well as the discretization (mesh size). The optimally-penalized formulation is tested for three benchmark problems, including one with available analytical solution. We also compare our results with those obtained by using the alternative irreversibility technique based on the notion of the history field by Miehe et al. (2010).},

The method is presented in both two and three dimensions (on triangular and tetrahedral meshes). The method is eﬃciently implementable by hybridization. The degrees of freedom of the Lagrange multipliers, which approximate the displacements at the faces, solve a symmetric positive-deﬁnite system. The design and analysis of this method is motivated by a new set of unisolvent degrees of freedom for symmetric polynomial matrices. These new degrees of freedom are also used to give a new simple calculation of the dimension of the space of polynomial symmetric matrix ﬁelds with vanishing normal traces and zero divergence on a tetrahedron. Such a dimension count was important in the development of the symmetric H(div) conforming methods found in [D. N. Arnold, G. Awanou, and R. Winther, Math. Comp., 77 (2008), pp. 1229–1251].},

An error estimate suggests the possibility of extensional locking, a feature that is confirmed by numerical experiments. Under-integration of the extensional edge terms is proposed as a remedy. This modification is shown to lead to an error estimate that is consistent with lockingfree behaviour.

This paper centers on assessing the energy costs of modern day society and its relation to GDP. Our most important focus is the characteristics of our major energy sources including each fuel's energy return on investment (EROI). The EROI of our most important fuels is declining and most renewable and nonconventional energy alternatives have substantially lower EROI values than traditional conventional fossil fuels. At the societal level, declining EROI means that an increasing proportion of energy output and economic activity must be diverted to attaining the energy needed to run an economy, leaving less discretionary funds available for “non-essential” purchases which often drive growth. The declining EROI of traditional fossil fuel energy sources and the effect of that on the world economy are likely to result in a myriad of consequences, most of which will not be perceived as good.},

To retrieve a well-posed problem, the material state is described through the gradients of damage in addition to the strain and the damage. Under some assumptions, it is shown that these gradient laws can be cast into a variational formulation. Its numerical treatment is reduced to the design of a mixed ﬁnite element so that algorithms such as Newton’s method and path-following techniques are still available. Possible convergence difﬁculties related to the reduction of the damage band width and the appearance of micro instabilities are removed thanks to the design of a new class of brittle laws. Finally, numerical applications show the convergence with mesh reﬁnement, the compatibility with coarser approaches such as Grifﬁth’s theory and cohesive crack models, the robustness in case of unstable multi-cracking, the applicability to full-scale 3D situations and the physical relevance compared to experimental data.},

	abstract = {In a period of a few decades, the formulation known as the principle of virtual power (PVP) has gained a prominent place among the most efﬁcient tools in the thermomechanics of continua. Strongly marked by a “continental” (French-Italian) inﬂuence, it has successfully incorporated the basic invariances of modern continuum mechanics while capturing the spirit of twentieth-century analysis (generalized functions or distributions) in which it became synonymous of weak formulation. It proved to provide the surest and safest way to formulate complex theories of continua (so-called “generalized continuum mechanics”, theory of coupled ﬁelds, etc) and approximate or generalized theories of structural members and the associated natural boundary conditions while preparing the way for the full thermomechanical formulation, providing the best setting for the proof of various mathematical theorems, and paving the way for modern numerical methods. The present contribution, illustrated by many examples of varying complexity, emphasizes the role of Paul Germain (1920–2009) in this formulation. The author, himself an active contributor and a never tired propagandist of the method, has participated in these developments during four decades and presents here his witness but critical viewpoint, highlighting the difﬁcult points and also the esthetically pleasing ones where necessary.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a modular formulation and computational implementation of a class of anisotropic plasticity models at ﬁnite strains based on incremental minimization principles. The modular kinematic setting consists of a constitutive model in the logarithmic strain space that is framed by a purely geometric pre- and postprocessing. On the theoretical side, the point of departure is an a priori six-dimensional approach to ﬁnite plasticity based on the notion of a plastic metric. In a ﬁrst step, a geometric preprocessor deﬁnes a total and a plastic logarithmic strain measure obtained from the current and the plastic metrics, respectively. In a second step, these strains enter in an additive format a constitutive model of anisotropic plasticity that may have a structure identical to the geometrically linear theory. The model deﬁnes the stresses and consistent tangents work-conjugate to the logarithmic strain measure. In a third step these objects of the logarithmic space are then mapped back to nominal, Lagrangian or Eulerian objects by a geometric postprocessor. This geometric three-step-approach deﬁnes a broad class of anisotropic models of ﬁnite plasticity directly related to counterparts of the geometrically linear theory. It is speciﬁed to a model problem of anisotropic metal plasticity. On the computational side we develop an incremental variational formulation of the above outlined constitutive structure where a quasi-hyperelastic stress potential is obtained from a local constitutive minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this minimization problem is exclusively restricted to the logarithmic strain space in a structure identical to the small-strain theory. The minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for ﬁnite increments of time. We develop a discrete formulation in terms of just one scalar parameter for the amount of incremental ﬂow. The existence of the incremental stress potential provides a natural basis for the deﬁnition of the geometric postprocessor based on function evaluations. Furthermore, the global initialboundary-value-problem of the elastic–plastic solid appears in the incremental setting as an energy minimization problem. Numerical examples show that the results obtained are surprisingly close to those obtained by a reference framework of multiplicative plasticity.},

	abstract = {We present hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving steady and timedependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in continuum mechanics. The essential ingredients are a local Galerkin projection of the underlying PDEs at the element level onto spaces of polynomials of degree k to parametrize the numerical solution in terms of the numerical trace; a judicious choice of the numerical ﬂux to provide stability and consistency; and a global jump condition that enforces the continuity of the numerical ﬂux to arrive at a global weak formulation in terms of the numerical trace. The HDG methods are fully implicit, high-order accurate and endowed with several unique features which distinguish themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, they reduce the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the solution on element boundaries, thereby leading to a signiﬁcant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Second, they provide, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of all the variables which converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm. Third, they possess some superconvergence properties that allow us to deﬁne inexpensive element-by-element postprocessing procedures to compute a new approximate solution which may converge with higher order than the original solution. And fourth, they allow for a novel and systematic way for imposing boundary conditions for the total stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the methods. In addition, they possess other interesting properties for speciﬁc problems. Their approximate solution can be postprocessed to yield an exactly divergence-free and H(div)-conforming velocity ﬁeld for incompressible ﬂows. They do not exhibit volumetric locking for nearly incompressible solids. We provide extensive numerical results to illustrate their distinct characteristics and compare their performance with that of continuous Galerkin methods. Ó 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

HHO methods are formulated in terms of face unknowns on the mesh skeleton. Cell unknowns are also introduced for the stability and approximation properties of the method. HHO methods oﬀer several advantages in solid mechanics: (i) primal formulation; (ii) free of volumetric locking due to incompressibility constraints; (iii) arbitrary approximation order k ≥ 1 ; (iv) support of polyhedral meshes with possibly nonmatching interfaces; and (v) attractive computational costs due to the static condensation to eliminate locally cell unknowns while keeping a compact stencil. In this thesis, primal HHO methods are devised to solve the problem of ﬁnite hyperelastic deformations and small plastic deformations. An extension to ﬁnite elastoplastic deformations is also presented within a logarithmic strain framework. Finally, a combination with Nitsche’s approach allows us to impose weakly the unilateral contact and Tresca friction conditions. Optimal convergence rates of order hk+1 are proved in the energy-norm. All these methods have been implemented in both the open-source library disk++ and the open-source industrial software code\_aster. Various two- and three-dimensional benchmarks are considered to validate these methods and compare them with H1-conforming and mixed ﬁnite element methods.},

	abstract = {A class of 'assumed strain' mixed finite element methods for fully non-linear problems in solid mechanics is presented which, when restricted to geometrically linear problems, encompasses the classical method of incompatiblemodes as a particular case. The method relies cruciallyon a local multiplicativedecomposition of the deformation gradient into a conforming and an enhanced part, formulated in the context of a three-field variational formulation. The resulting class of mixed methods provides a possible extension to the nonlinear regime of well-known incompatible mode formulations. In addition, this class of methods includes non-linear generalizations of recently proposed enhanced strain interpolations for axisymmetric problems which cannot be interpreted as incompatible modes elements. The good performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated in a number of simulations including 2-D, 3-D and axisymmetric finite deformation problems in elasticity and elastoplasticity. Remarkably, these methods appear to be specially well suited for problems involving localization of the deformation, as illustrated in several numerical examples.},

In consonance with general discontinuous Galerkin formulations, it is possible within this framework to choose different numerical ﬂuxes. Numerical evidence suggests the absence of locking at nearincompressible conditions in the ﬁnite deformations regime when piecewise linear elements are adopted. Finally, a conceivable surprising characteristic is that, as demonstrated with numerical examples, these methods provide a given accuracy level for a comparable, and often lower, computational cost than conforming formulations.},

One of the limitations of the continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method (CGFEM) when applied to incompressible elasticity is that the accuracy of the numerical solution may be adversely affected by the phenomenon known as locking—this may prevent the use of a low order polynomial approximation to the displacement on each element. We demonstrate using simulations that the DGFEM presented here does not suffer from this drawback. Two further advantages in this setting of this DGFEM over CGFEMs are that: (i) highly anisotropic meshes—meshes containing elements with a very high aspect ratio—may be used without signiﬁcantly degrading the accuracy of the solution; and (ii) discontinuities in the elasticity parameters are handled more effectively.},

	abstract = {Our goal in this work is to develop and compare modified Newton methods for fully monolithic quasi-static brittle phasefield fracture propagation. In variational phase-field fracture, a smoothed phase-field indicator variable denoting the crack path is coupled to elasticity. Moreover, a crack irreversibility condition is incorporated. To develop a fully monolithic scheme is an extremely challenging task since the underlying problem is non-convex and the Jacobian of Newton’s method is indefinite. To split the problem using alternating minimization, thus a partitioned approach, is a possible resort. However, there are good reasons to consider monolithic approaches such as for example robustness and efficiency. Although an error-oriented Newton method can cope with a larger variety of configurations, it appears that this method is not always robust and also not always efficient. Inspired by nonlinear flow problems, as alternative, we develop a modified Newton scheme in which globalization is based on a dynamic modification of the Jacobian matrix rather than utilizing line-search or trust-region strategies. This variation switches smoothly between full Newton and Newton-like steps. In several 2D and 3D numerical examples, all of them with different characteristic features, our modified Newton solver is compared to a backtracking line-search Newton method, another line-search method monitoring the global energy and allowing for negative curvatures, and to already published results of an error-oriented version. These computations also include further modifications of Newton’s method and detailed discussions why certain schemes either work or fail. Revisiting all findings, the main outcome of this paper is that the modified Newton scheme with Jacobian modification is currently the only method that works in a robust and efficient way for all provided examples, whereas line-search schemes or the error-oriented scheme show deficiencies for certain configurations.},

	abstract = {High-order numerical methods for unstructured grids combine the superior accuracy of high-order spectral or finite difference methods with the geometric flexibility of low-order finite volume or finite element schemes. The Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach unifies various high-order schemes for unstructured grids within a single framework. Additionally, the FR approach exhibits a significant degree of element locality, and is thus able to run efficiently on modern streaming architectures, such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The aforementioned properties of FR mean it offers a promising route to performing affordable, and hence industrially relevant, scale-resolving simulations of hitherto intractable unsteady flows within the vicinity of real-world engineering geometries. In this paper we present PyFR, an open-source Python based framework for solving advection–diffusion type problems on streaming architectures using the FR approach. The framework is designed to solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids containing various element types. It is also designed to target a range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific language based on the Mako templating engine. The current release of PyFR is able to solve the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on grids of quadrilateral and triangular elements in two dimensions, and hexahedral elements in three dimensions, targeting clusters of CPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs. Results are presented for various benchmark flow problems, single-node performance is discussed, and scalability of the code is demonstrated on up to 104 NVIDIA M2090 GPUs.

	abstract = {Despite the versatility in modeling complex crack conﬁgurations, phase-ﬁeld damage models for fracture usually count only one in-house codes, greatly restricting their potential applications. It is thus of vital importance to implement them in those commonly used commercial software packages like Abaqus. However, so far only the less robust Newton’s monolithic algorithm or the inefﬁcient staggered solver has been considered. In this work, taking the uniﬁed phase-ﬁeld damage theory (Wu, 2017) as the particular example, we present three distinct strategies of implementing phase-ﬁeld damage models into Abaqus: (i) UMAT-Newton-M: a thermo-mechanically coupled user-deﬁned material (UMAT) implementation of the modiﬁed Newton monolithic solver; (ii) UEL-Staggered: a novel user-deﬁned element (UEL) implementation of the iterative staggered (alternate minimization) algorithm with dummy dofs; (iii) UEL-BFGS: a UEL implementation of the recently advocated BFGS quasi-Newton monolithic algorithm. The aforesaid implementation strategies are then validated against several representative benchmark problems of brittle fracture and quasi-brittle failure. It is found that, the UMAT-Newton-M implementation is the simplest but not robust enough, while the UEL-Staggered implementation is robust but extremely inefﬁcient. Comparatively, in all cases the UELBFGS scheme is of the best numerical performance with lest iterations and sufﬁcient robustness. For the sake of reproducibility of the presented numerical results and the promotion of phase-ﬁeld damage models, the source codes (programmed in the free format syntax of FORTRAN90) are also provided and interested users can download them at https://github.com/jianyingwu/pfczm-abaqus.},

	abstract = {The major goal of this work is to develop a robust modelling strategy for the simulation of ductile damage development including crack initiation and subsequent propagation. For that purpose, a Gurson‐type model is used. This model class, as many other damage models, leads to significant material softening and must be used within a large deformation framework due to the ductile character of the materials. This leads to 2 main difficulties that should be dealt with carefully: mesh dependency and volumetric locking. In this work, a logarithmic finite strain framework is adopted in which the Gurson‐TvergaardNeedleman constitutive law is reformulated. Then a nonlocal formulation with regularisation of hardening variable is applied so as to solve mesh dependency and strain localization problem. In addition, the nonlocal model is combined with mixed “displacement‐pressure‐volume variation” elements to avoid volumetric locking. Thereby, a mesh‐independent and locking‐free finite strain framework suitable for the modelling of ductile rupture is established. Attention is paid to mathematical properties and numerical performance of the model. Finally, the model parameters are identified on an experimental database for a nuclear piping steel. Simulations of standard test specimens (notched tensile bars and compact tension and single edge notched tensile cracked specimens) are performed and compared to experimental results.},

In this article, we first formulate the quasi-static evolution problem for a general class of such damage models. Then, we introduce a stability criterion in terms of the positivity of the second derivative of the total energy under the unilateral constraint induced by the irreversibility of damage. These concepts are applied in the particular setting of a one-dimensional traction test. We construct homogeneous as well as localized damage solutions in a closed form and illustrate the concepts of loss of stability, of scale effects, of damage localization, and of structural failure. Considering several specific constitutive models, stress—displacement curves, stability diagrams, and energy dissipation provide identification criteria for the relevant material parameters, such as limit stress and internal length. Finally, the 1D analytical results are compared with the numerical solution of the evolution problem in a 2D setting.},

A simple postprocessing is introduced which takes advantage of the special structure of the method. It allows us to construct an approximation to the displacement which is H(div)-conforming and to enforce the equation that links the pressure to the divergence of the displacement strongly inside each element. As a consequence, when the material is exactly incompressible, the displacement is also exactly incompressible. This is achieved without having to deal with the almost impossible task of constructing ﬁnite dimensional subspaces of incompressible displacements. We provide an error analysis of the method that holds uniformly with respect to the Poisson ratio. In particular, we show that the displacement converges in L2 with order k + 1 when polynomials of degree k {\textbackslash}textgreater 0 are used. We also display numerical experiments conﬁrming that the theoretical orders of convergence are actually achieved and that they do not deteriorate when the material becomes incompressible.},

A discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation is developed, which circumvents this source of error. A patch-based version of the DG formulation is developed, which decomposes the domain into enriched and unenriched subdomains. Continuity between patches is enforced with an internal penalty method. An element-based form is also developed, where each element is considered a patch. The patch-based DG is shown to have similar accuracy to the element-based DG for a given discretization but requires significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The method is applied to material interfaces, cracks and dislocation problems. For the dislocations, a contour integral form of the internal forces that only requires integration over the patch boundaries is developed. A previously developed assumed strain (AS) method is also developed further and compared with the DG method for weak discontinuities and linear elastic cracks. The DG method is shown to be significantly more accurate than the standard XFEM for a given element size and to converge optimally, even where the standard XFEM does not. The accuracy of the DG method is similar to that of the AS method but requires less application-specific coding. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We introduce here a variant of the XFEM rendering an optimally convergent scheme. Its distinguishing features are as follows: (a) the introduction of singular asymptotic crack tip fields with support on only a small region around the crack tip (the enrichment region), (b) only one and two enrichment functions are added for anti-plane shear and planar problems, respectively and (c) the relaxation of the continuity between the enrichment region and the rest of the domain, and the adoption of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method therein. The method is provably stable for any positive value of a stabilization parameter, and by weakly enforcing the continuity between the two regions it eliminates ‘blending elements’ partly responsible for the suboptimal convergence of some early XFEMs. Moreover, the particular choice of enrichment functions results in a surprisingly sparse stiffness matrix that remains reasonably conditioned as the mesh is refined. More importantly, the stress intensity factors can be extracted with a satisfactory accuracy as primary unknowns. Quadrature strategies required for the optimal convergence are also discussed. Finally, the DG method was modified to retain stability based on an inf-sup condition. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The treatment for this discontinuity, generally a non-polynomial function, is facilitated by a specially designed discontinuous Galerkin method based on the Bassi–Rebay numerical flux. The stability of the method is contingent upon an inf–sup condition, which we have proved to hold for any quasiuniform mesh family with sufficiently fine meshes. We have also shown the optimal convergence of the displacement and stress fields, and the convergence of the stress intensity factors extracted as the coefficients of the enrichment functions.},

We introduce a continuous mapping between a ﬁxed reference conﬁguration and the time-varying domain. By writing the Navier–Stokes equations as a conservation law for the independent variables in the reference conﬁguration, the complexity introduced by variable geometry is reduced to solving a transformed conservation law in a ﬁxed reference conﬁguration. The spatial discretization is carried out using the Discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured meshes of triangles, while the time integration is performed using an explicit Runge–Kutta method. For general domain changes, the standard scheme fails to preserve exactly the free-stream solution which leads to some accuracy degradation, especially for low order approximations. This situation is remedied by adding an additional equation for the time evolution of the transformation Jacobian to the original conservation law and correcting for the accumulated metric integration errors. A number of results are shown to illustrate the ﬂexibility of the approach to handle high-order approximations on complex geometries.},

We prove that these schemes meet the main mathematical gradient discretisation properties on any kind of polytopal mesh, by adapting discrete functional analysis properties to our precise geometrical hypotheses. Therefore, these schemes inherit the general convergence properties of the GDM, which hold for instance in the cases of the p-Laplace problem and of the anisotropic and heterogeneous diffusion problem. This is illustrated by simple 1D and 2D numerical examples.},

	abstract = {The phase-field approach regularizes the variational theory of fracture by approximating cracks with a smeared damage field. In this work, the attention is focused on those formulations approximating mode II fractures (shear fractures). In these models, only the deviatoric part of the strain elastic energy, penalized by the phase-field, drives the crack onset and evolution, whereas the elastic hydrostatic energetic contribution has no influence on the failure process. Consequently, cracks evolves according to the von Mises–Hencky–Hüber, also known as J2, failure criterion. Unfortunately, volumetric locking problem arises in the damaged zones if classical numerical solution strategies are adopted. As a consequence, damage localization bands appear with an excessive thickness, thus overestimating the fracture energy. In addition, the crack path geometry may be erroneously described because of the loss of precision of the displacement field in damaged zones. To circumvent these drawbacks, two numerical techniques are proposed, namely selective reduced integration and mixed displacement/pressure formulation, and their effectiveness evidenced by a numerical investigation.},
